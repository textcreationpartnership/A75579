            <title>Aristotle's master-piece compleated in two parts: the first containing the secrets of generation, in all the parts thereof. Treating, of the benefit of marriage, and the prejudice of unequal matches, signs of insufficiency in men or women; of the infusion of the soul; of the likeness of children to parents; of monstrous births; the cause and cure of the green-sickness: a discourse of virginity. Directions and cautions for mid-wives. Of the organs of generation in women, and the fabrick of the womb. The use and action of the genitals. Signs of conception, and whether of a male or female. With a word of advice to both sexes in the act of copulation. And the pictures of several monstrous births, &amp;c. The second part, being a private looking-glass for the female sex. Treating of the various maladies of the womb; and of all other distempers incident to women of all ages, with proper remedies for the cure of each. The whole being more correct, than any thing of this kind hitherto published.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THERE are very few (except ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Debauchees) but what will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agree, That Marriage is Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being Ordain'd by Heaven in Paradiſe; and without which no Man or Woman can be in a Capacity honeſtly to yield obedience to the firſt Law of the Creation, <hi>Increaſe and multiply.</hi> And ſince it is Natural in young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153810:8"/>to deſire thoſe mutual Embraces proper to the Marriage-Bed, it behoves Parents to look after their Children; and when they find them inclinable to Marriage, not violently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their Affections, and oppoſe their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (which inſtead of allaying them, makes 'em but the more impetuous) but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſuch ſuitable Matches for them as may make their Lives comfortable: Leſt the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Inclinations ſhould precipitate them to commit thoſe Follies that may bring an indelible ſtain upon their Families.</p>
                  <p>The Inclination of Maids to Marriage, is to be known by many Symptoms: For when they arrive to Puberty, (which is about the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth or Fifteenth year of their Age) then their Natural Purgations begin to flow: And the Blood, which is no longer taken to augment their Bodies, abounding, ſtirs up their Minds to Venery. External Cauſes alſo may incite them to it; for the Spirits being brisk and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd when they arrive at this Age, if they eat ſharp ſalt things and Spices, the Body becomes more and more heated, whereby the Deſire to Venereal Embraces is very great, and at ſome times almoſt inſuperable: And the uſe of theſe ſo much deſir'd Enjoyments being deny'd to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, is many times follow'd by diſmal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, as a green Weaſel-colour, ſhort Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, Trembling of the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when they are married, and their Venereal Deſires ſatisfied by the Enjoyment of their Husbands,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153810:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe Diſtempers vaniſh, and their former Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty returns, more gay and lively than before. Alſo their eager gazing at Men, and affecting their company; ſufficiently demonſtrates that Nature prompts them to deſire Coition; which their Parents often neglecting or refuſing to provide, by procuring them Husbands, they break the Bounds of Modeſty, and ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in unlawful Embraces. The ſame may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in young brisk Widows, who cannot be ſatified without that Due Benevolence which they were wont to receive from their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
                  <p>At Fourteen Years of Age, commonly the <hi>Menſes</hi> in Virgins begin to flow, at which time they are capable of Conceiving, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue generally to Forty-four; at which time for the moſt part they ceaſe bearing, unleſs they be very healthful and ſtrong of Body, and have always been addicted to Temperance; ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have born Children till Fifty-five years; but this rarely happens, altho' the <hi>Menſes</hi> flow a longer time in ſome Women than in others; but many times ſuch Efflux proceeds not from a natural Cauſe, but by reaſon of ſome violence offer'd to Nature, or ſome other Morbifick matter, which often proves of fatal conſequence to the Party: And therefore thoſe Men that are deſirous of Iſue, muſt marry Women within the Age aforeſaid, or blame themſelves if they meet with diſappointments: Tho' if an old Man, not worn out by Diſeaſes and Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

                     <hi>Hipocrates</hi> is of Opinion that a Youth, at Sixteen years, or between that and Seventeen having much vital ſtrength, may be capable of getting Chi'dren; and alſo that the Force and Heat of Procreating Matter conſtantly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes till Forty-five, Fifty, and Sixty-five, and then begins to flag, the Seed by degrees becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfruitful; the natural Spirits being extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and the Humours dried up: Thus it is in general; but as to particulars, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, it often happens otherwiſe: Nay, it is reported by a credible <hi>Author,</hi> That in <hi>Sweedland</hi> a Man was married at a hundred years old to a Bride of Thirty, and had many Children by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Paſſive Principle is a <hi>Ovum</hi> or Egg, impregnated by the Man's Seed. For to ſay that Woman has true Seed, is erronious. But the manner of Conception is thus: The moſt Spirituous part of Man's Seed in the Act of Generation, reaching up to the <hi>Ovarium</hi> or Teſticles of the Woman (which contain divers Eggs, ſometime more, ſometimes fewer) impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates one of them, which being convey'd by the <hi>Ovi-ducts</hi> to the bottom of the Womb, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begins to ſwell bigger and bigger, and drinks in the moiſture that is plentifully ſent th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>LActantius</hi> is of Opinion, That when a Man's Seed falls on the left ſide of the Womb, it may produce a Male Child; but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153810:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe it is the proper place for a Female, there will be ſomething in it that reſembles a Woman; that is, it will be fairer, whiter and ſmoother, not very ſubject to have Hair on the Body or Chin; it will have long lank Hair on the Head, the Voice ſmall and ſharp, and the Courage feeble: And on the contrary, That a Female may perchance be gotten if the Seed fall on the Right Side; but then through the abundance of Heat ſhe will be big bon'd, full of Courage, having a Maſculine Voice, and her Chin and Boſom hairy, not being ſo clear as others of that Sex, and ſubject to quarrel with her Husband for Superiority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In caſe of Similitude, nothing is more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful than the Imagination of the Mother, for if ſhe faſten her Eyes upon any Object, and imprint it in her Mind, it oft times ſo happens, that the Child in ſome part or other of its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has a repreſentation thereof: And if in the Act of Copulation the Woman earneſtly look upon the Man, and fix her Mind upon him, the Child will reſemble its Father: Nay, though a Woman be in unlawful Copulation, yet if ſhe fix her Mind upon her Husband, the Child will reſemble him, though he never got it. The ſame effect of the Imagination is the cauſe of Warts, Stains, Moldſpots, Daſhes; tho' indeed they ſometimes happen through frights or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Longing: Many Women big with Child, ſeeing a Hare croſs them, will through the ſtrength of Imagination bring forth a Child
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153810:15"/>with a hairy Lip. Some Children are born with flat Noſes, wry Mouths, great blubber Lips, and ill-ſhap'd Bodies; and moſt aſcribe the reaſon to the Imagination of the Mother, who has caſt her Eyes and Mind upon ſome ill-ſhap'd and diſtorted Creatures: Therefore it behoves all Women with Child to avoid ſuch ſights, if poſſible, or at leaſt, not to regard 'em. But tho' the Mothers Imagination may contribute much to the Features of the Child; yet in Manners, Wit, and Propenſion of the Mind, Experience tells us, That Children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of the ſame condition with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and of the ſame Tempers. But the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor or Debility of Perſons in the Act of Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, many times cauſes it to be otherwiſe: For Children got with heat and ſtrength of deſire, muſt needs partake more of the Nature and Inclinations of their Parents, than thoſe that are begotten when their Deſires are more weak and feeble; and therefore the Children that are begotten by Men in their old Age, are generally leſs ſtrong and vigorous, than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by them in their Youth.</p>
                  <p>As to that ſhare which each of the Parents have in begetting the Child, we will give the Opinion of the Antients about it.</p>
                  <p>Though it is apparent <hi>(ſay they)</hi> that the Seed of Man is the chief Efficient and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Action, Motion, and Generation, yet the Woman affords Seed, and effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in that particular to the Procreation of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153810:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Child, is evinced by ſtrong Reaſons. In the firſt place Seminary Veſſels had been given her in vain, and Genital Teſticles inverted, if the Woman wanted Seminal Excreſſence; for Nature doth nothing in vain: therefore it muſt be granted they were made for the uſe of Seed and Procreation, and fixed in their proper Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both the Teſticles and Receptacles of Seed, whoſe Nature is to operate, and afford Vertue to the Seed. And to prove this, there needs no ſtronger Argument (ſay they) than that if a Woman do not uſe Copulation, to eject her Seed, ſhe often times falls into ſtrange Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as appears by young Women and Virgins. A ſecond reaſon they urge, is, That altho' the Society of a lawful Bed does not conſiſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe things, yet it is apparent that the Female Sex is never better pleas'd, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more blithe and jocund, than when they are often ſatisfied this way, which is an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe that they have greater Pleaſure and Titilation therein, than a Man; for ſince Nature cauſes much Delight to accompany Eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by the breaking forth of the ſwelling Spirit, and the ſtiffneſs of the Nerves, in which caſe the Operation on the Womans part is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhe having an enjoyment both by Ejection and Reception, by which ſhe is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Venerial Act.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is (ſay they) that the Child more frequently reſembles the Mother than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the Mother contributes moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153810:16"/>it: And they think it may be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced from the endeared Affection they bear them; for that beſides their contributing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal matter, they feed and nouriſh the Child with the pureſt Fountain of <hi>Blood,</hi> until its <hi>Birth,</hi> which Opinion <hi>Gallen</hi> confirms, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Children to participate moſt of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and aſcribes the difference of Sex to the Operation of the <hi>Menſtrual Blood;</hi> but the reaſon of the Likeneſs he refers to the power of the Seed; for as Plants receive more nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from fruitful Ground, than from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Husbandman, ſo the <hi>Infant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in more abundance from the <hi>Mother</hi> than the <hi>Father:</hi> for firſt, the Seed of both is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in the Womb, and there grows to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, being nouriſhed with <hi>Blood.</hi> and for this reaſon it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s (ſay they) that Children for the moſt part love their <hi>Mothers</hi> beſt, becauſe they receive moſt of their ſubſtance from their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> for about nine Months, and ſometimes ten, ſhe nouriſheth the Child in the Womb with her pureſt Blood; then her love toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But in all this the Antients were very Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious; for the Teſticles (ſo called) in Women do not afford any Seed, but are two Eggs, like thoſe of Fowls, and other Creatures; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153810:17"/>are indeed <hi>Ovarium,</hi> wherein theſe Eggs are nouriſhed by the Sanguinary Veſſels diſperſed through them, and from thence one or more (as they are fecundated by the Mans Seed) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and are convey'd into the Womb by the <hi>Ovi duces.</hi> The truth of this is plain; for if you boil them, their Liquor will have the ſame Colour, Taſte and Conſiſtency, with the Taſte of Birds Eggs: If any object they have no Shells, that ſignifies nothing, for the Eggs of Fowls, while they are in the <hi>Ovary,</hi> nay, after they are fallen into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> have no Shell: And tho' when they are laid, they have one, yet that is no more than a Fence which Nature has provided them againſt outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, while they are hatched without the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whereas thoſe of Women being hatched within the Body, need no other Fence than the Womb, by which they are ſufficiently enough ſecured.</p>
                  <p>And this is enough, I hope, for the clearing of this point. As to the third thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Whence grows the kind, and whether the Man or the Woman is the Cauſe of the Male or Female Infant?</p>
                  <p>The primary cauſe we muſt aſcribe to God, (as is moſt juſtly his due) who is the Ruler and Diſpoſer of all things, yet does He ſuffer many things to proceed according to the Rules of Nature, which are carried by their inbred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to uſual and natural Courſe, without Variation. Tho' indeed by Favour
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153810:17"/>from on high, <hi>Sarah</hi> conceived <hi>Iſaac; Hannah, Samuel;</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, John</hi> the <hi>Baptist:</hi> But theſe were extraordinary things, brought to paſs by a Divine Power, above the Courſe of Nature, nor have ſuch inſtances been wanting in latter Days: And therefore paſſing over ſuch Supernatural Cauſes, that have their peculiar Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I ſhall proceed to ſpeak of things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The Ancient Phyſicians and Philoſophers ſay, That ſince there are two Principles, out of which the Body of Man is made, and which render the Child like the Parents, and to be of one or the other Sex, <hi>viz.</hi> Seed, common to both Sexes, and Menſtrual Blood, proper to the Woman only: The Similitude (ſay they) muſt needs conſiſt in the force and virtue of the Male or Female Seed, ſo that it proves like one or other, according to the plenty afforded by either; but that the difference of Sex is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Seed, but to the Menſtrual Blood, which is proper to the Woman, is apparent; for were that force altogether retained in the Seed, the Male Seed being of the hotteſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Male Children would abound, and few of the Female would be propagated: Wherefore the Sex is attributed to the Temperament of the Active Qualities, which conſiſt in Heat and Cold, and to the Nature of the matter under them, that is, to the flowings of the Menſtrual Blood: Now the Seed (ſay they) affords both force to procreate and form the Child, and matter for its Generation, and in the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:153810:19"/>Blood there is both matter and force; for as the Seed moſt helps the material Principles, ſo alſo does the Menſtrual Blood the potential Seed, which is (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) Blood well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Veſſels that contain it; ſo that Blood is not only the matter of generating the Child, but alſo Seed, in poſſibility that Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual Blood hath both Principles.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients further ſay, That the Seed is the ſtrongeſt Efficient, the matter of it being very little in quantity, but the potential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it is very ſtrong: Wherefore if the Principle of Generation, according to which the Sex is made, were only (ſay they) in the Menſtrual Blood, then would the Children be all, or moſtly, Females; as, if the efficient force was in the Seed, they would be all Males: But that ſince both have operation, in Menſtrual Blood, Matter predominates in quantity; and in the Seed, Force and Vertue. And therefore <hi>Galen</hi> thinks the Child receives its Sex rather from the Mother, than from the Father, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' his Seed contribute ſomething to the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Principle, yet it is more weakly. But as for Likeneſs, it is referred rather to the Father than the Mother: Yet the Womans Seed receiving ſtrength from the Menſtrual Blood, for the ſpace of Nine Months, over-powers the Man's, as to that particu'ar; for the Menſtrual Blood howing into the Veſſels, rather cheriſhes the one than the other; from which it is plain, the Woman affords both matter to make, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153810:19"/>force and vertue to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>fect the Conception, tho' the Female's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> fit Nutriment for the Male's, by reaſon of the thinneſs of it, being more adapted to make up Conception thereby; for as of ſoft Wax and moiſt Clay the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can frame what he intends, ſo (ſay they) the <hi>Man</hi>'s Seed mixing with the <hi>Woman</hi>'s, and alſo with the menſtrual Blood, helps to make the form and perfect part of <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, with all imaginable Deference to the Wiſdom of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> give me leave to ſay, That their Ignorance in the Anatomy of <hi>Mans</hi> Body, has bewilder'd 'em in the Paths of Error, and led them into great miſtakes: For their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> of the Formation of the <hi>Embryo</hi> from a Commixture of Seeds, and the Nouriſhment of it from the menſtruous Blood, being wholly falſe, their Opinion in this caſe muſt needs be ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore conclude this Chapter, and only ſay, That altho a ſtrong Imagination of the <hi>Mother</hi> may ſometimes determine the Sex, yet the main Agent in this caſe is the <hi>Plaſtic</hi> or <hi>Formative Principle,</hi> which is the Efficient in giving Form to the Child, that gives it this or that Sex, according to thoſe Laws and Rules that are given to it by the wiſe Creator of all things, who both maketh and faſhioneth it, and therein determines the Sex according to the Counſel of his own Will.</p>

                  <p>MAN's Soul is of ſo Divine a Nature and Excellency, that Man himſelf cannot in any wiſe comprehend it, it being the infuſed Breath of the Almighty, of an Immortal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and not to be comprehended, but by him that gave it. For <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Holy Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, relating the Original of Man, tells us, <hi>That God breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul.</hi> Now, as for all other Creatures, at his Word they were made, and had Life; but the Creature that God hath appointed to ſet over his Works, was the peculiar Workmanſhip of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Forming him out of the Duſt of the Earth, and condeſcending to breathe into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life; which ſeems to Denote, more Care, and (if we may ſo term it) Labour uſed about Man, than about all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he only partaking and participating with the Divine Nature, bearing the Image of God,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153810:20"/>in Innocence and Purity, whilſt he ſtood firm; and when by his Fall, that lively Image was defaced, yet ſuch was the Love of his Creator towards him, that he found out a way to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him; the only begotten Son of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father coming into the World to deſtroy the works of the Devil; and to raiſe up Man from that low Condition to which his Sin and Fall had reduc'd him, to a State above that of the Angels.</p>
                  <p>If therefore Man would underſtand the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Soul, let him turn his Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and look into himſelf, and ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently his own Mind, and there he ſhall find ſo many admirable Gifts, and excellent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it muſt needs ſtrike him with Wonder and Amazement, as Reaſon, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Freedom of Will, Memory, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Faculties, that plainly ſhew the Soul to be deſcended from an Heavenly Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and that therefore it is of an infinite Duration, and not ſubject to Annihilation. Yet by reaſon of its many Offices and Operations, whilſt in the Body, it goes under ſundry Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. For when it enlivens the Body, it is called the Soul; when it gives it Knowledge, the Judgment or the Mind; when it recalls things paſt, the Memory; whilſt it diſcourſeth and diſcerneth, Reaſon; whilſt it contemplates, the Spirit; whilſt it is in the Senſitive parts, the Senſes: And theſe are the princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ighty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately proceeding from him; not paſſing from one to another, as we the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who held a Tranſmigration of the Soul: But that the Soul is given to every Infant by Infuſion, is the moſt generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and Orthodox Opinion; and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do likewiſe agree that this is done, when the Infant is perfected in the Womb, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens about the 45th day after Conception, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Males, that are generally born at the end of Nine Months, but in Females (who are not ſo ſoon formed and perfected thro' the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of heat) not till the 50th day.</p>
                  <p>And altho' this day in all caſes cannot be perfectly ſet down, yet <hi>Hipocrates</hi> has given his Opinion, when the Child has its perfect form, when it begins to move, and when born, if in due ſeaſon: for in his Book of the Nature of Infants, he affirmeth, That if it be a Male, and he be perfect on the 30th day, and move at the 60th, he will be Born at the ſeventh Month; but if he be perfectly formed on the 35th day, he will move one 70th, and be born in the 8th Month. Again, if he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly formed on the 45th day, he will move on the 90th, and be born in the Ninth Month. Now, from theſe paſſing of Days and Months,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153810:21"/>it plainly appears, That the day of Forming being doubled, makes up the day of moving; and that day three times reckoned, makes up the day of Birth.</p>
                  <p>As for Example, where 35 perfect, the Form, if you double it, it makes 70, the day of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and three times 70 amounts to 210 Days, which, allowing 30 Days to a Month, makes ſeven Months; and ſo you muſt conſider the reſt. But as to a Female, the Caſe is different, for it is longer perfecting in the Womb, the Mother ever goes longer with a Boy than a Girl, ſo that the Accompt differs; for a Female formed in 30 Days, moves not till the 70th day, and is born in the 7th Month; when ſhe is formed in the 40th day, ſhe moves not till the 80th day, and is born in the 8th Month; but if ſhe be perfectly formed on the 55th day, ſhe moves on the 90th, and is born on the 9th Month; but ſhe that is formed on the 50th day, moves on the 100th day, and then will ſhe be born in the 10th Month. And I have more largely treated hereof, that the Reader may know the reaſonable Soul is not Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Parents, but is Infuſed by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, when the Child hath its perfect Form, and is exactly diſtinguiſhed in its Lineaments.</p>
                  <p>Now, as the life of every other Creature, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews, is in the Blood, ſo the life of Man conſiſteth in the Soul; which, although ſubject to Paſſion, by reaſon of the groſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

It has been diſputed amongſt the Learned, eſpecially Philoſophers, in what part of the Body the Soul reſides: and ſome are of Opinion, that its reſidence is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Heart, and from thence communicates its ſelf to every part; which <hi>Solomon</hi> in the fourth of his <hi>Proverbs</hi> ſeems to aſſert, when he ſays, <hi>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence, becauſe Life proceedeth therefrom</hi> But many curious Phyſicians, ſearching the works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Man's Anatomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do affirm, That it's chief Seat is in the Brain, from whence proceeds the Senſes, Faculties and Actions, diffuſing the operation of the Soul through all parts of the Body, whereby it is enlivened with Heat and Force; but it doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate particular force to the Heart by Arteries, Carotides, or ſleepy Arteries, that part upon the Throat; the which, if they happen to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For tho' the Soul has its chief ſeat in one place, it operates in every part, exerciſing every Member, which are the Soul's Inſtruments, by which ſhe ſhews her power: but if it happen that any of the Organical parts are out of Tune, the work is confuſed, as appears in Idiots, Mad-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho' in ſome of them, the Soul by a vigorous erecting of it's Power, recover its innate Strength, and they become right, after a long diſpondency of Mind: But in others, it is not recover'd again in this Life. For as Fire under Aſhes, or the Sun obſcured from our ſight by thick Clouds, afford not their full Luſtre, ſo the Soul over-whelm'd in moiſt or morbifick matter, is darkened, and Reaſon thereby overclouded; and altho' Reaſon ſhines leſs in Children, than in ſuch as are arrived to maturity, yet no man muſt imagine that the Soul is an Infant, and grows up with the Child; for then would it again decay; but it ſuits it ſelf to the weakneſs of Nature, and the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of the Body wherein it is placed, that it may better operate. And as the Body is more and more capable of receiving it's influence, ſo the Soul does more and more exert its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; having force and endowments at the time it enters the form of the Child in the VVomb, for the ſubſtance of it can receive nothing leſs.

                  <p>That the Soul of Man is a Divine Ray, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Sovereign Creator, I have already prov'd, and now come to ſhew, That whatever immediately proceeds from him, and participates of his Nature, muſt be as immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal as its Original; for altho' all other Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are indewed with Life and Motion, yet want they a reaſonable Soul; and from thence 'tis concluded, That their Life is in their Blood, and that being Corruptible, they Periſh, and are no more. But Man being indewed with a reaſonable Soul, and ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Divine Image, is of a different nature; and tho' his Body be Corruptible, yet his Soul, being of an immortal Nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Periſh, but muſt, at the diſſolution of its Body, return to God that gave it, either to receive Reward or Puniſhment: Now that the Body can ſin of it ſelf, it is impoſſible, becauſe wanting the Soul (which is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life) it cannot act nor proceed to any thing, either Good or Evil; for could it do ſo, it might ſin, even in the Grave: but 'tis plain, that after Death there is a ceſſation, <hi>For as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment finds us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Reaſon having evidently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Souls Immortality, the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do abundantly give Teſtimony to the

                  <p>In Magnitude, when one part doth not equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with another, as when one part is too big, or too little for the other parts of the body; and this is ſo common amongſt us, that I need not produce a Teſtimony for it.</p>
                  <p>In Situation, as if the Ears were on the Face and the Eyes on the Breſt or Legs, of this

                  <p>I proceed to the Cauſe of their Generation, which is either Divine or Natural. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine cauſe proceeds from the permiſſive will of God; ſuffering Parents to bring forth ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153810:25"/>abominations, for their filthy and corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are let looſe unto Wickedneſs, like brute Beaſts that have no Underſtanding. Wherefore it was Enacted amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Romans,</hi> That thoſe which were any ways deformed, ſhould not be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Religious Houſes. And St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his time was Grieved to ſee the Deformed and Lame offered up to God in Religious Houſes. And <hi>Kekerman,</hi> by way of inference, Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all that are mis-ſhapen, from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Function in the Church: And that which is of more force than all, God himſelf Commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> not to receive ſuch to offer Sacrifice amongſt his People; and he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Reaſon, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.18. <hi>Lest he Pollute my Sanctuaries:</hi> Becauſe the outward Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Body is often a ſign of the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart, as a Curſe laid upon the Child for the Parents Incontinency. Yet there are many born depraved, which ought not to be aſcribed unto the infirmity of the Parents. Let us therefore ſearch out the Natural Cauſe of their Generation: which (according to the Antients, who have dived into the Secrets of Nature) is either in the Matter, or in the Agent, in the Seed, or in the Womb.</p>
                  <p>The matter may be in fault two ways, by Defect, or by Exceſs. By Defect, when as the Child hath but one Arm. As in the following Figure.</p>

                  <p>By Exceſs, when it hath three Hands or two Heads. Some monſters alſo are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by VVomens unnatural lying with Beaſts, as in the Year 1393, there was a monſter begotten by a VVoman's Generating with a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153810:26"/>Dog: which monſter from the Navel upwards had the perfect Reſemblance of its Mother, but from the Navel downwards, it reſembled a Dog. As you may here ſee.</p>

                  <p>The Agent, or Womb, may be in fault three ways. Firſt, in the Formative Faculty, which may be too ſtrong, or too weak, by which is procured a depraved Figure. Secondly, in the Inſtrument or place of Conception, the evil conformation or evil diſpoſition whereof, will cauſe a monſtrous Birth. Thirdly, in the imaginative power at the time of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is of ſuch force that it ſtamps the Character of the thing imagined upon the Child: So that the Children of an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs may be like unto her own Husband, tho' begotten by another man; which is cauſed through the force of the Imagination which the Woman hath of her own Husband in the Act of Coition. And I have heard of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who at the time of Conception behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Picture of a Black-more, conceived and brought forth an <hi>Aethiopian.</hi> I will not trouble you with any more humane Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but I will conclude with a ſtronger War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.

                  <p>And certain it is, That oftentimes monſtrous Births happens by means of undue Copulation: For ſome Men and VVomen there are, That having been long abſent from each other, and having an eager deſire to enjoy one another, conſider not (as they ought to do) what their Circumſtances are; and if it happen that they come together at the time when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tho' ſuch Copulations do not always produce monſtrous Births, yet the Children then gotten are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Heavy, Dull and Sluggiſh, and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in their Underſtandings, wanting the Vivacity and Livelineſs which Children got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in proper Seaſons are bleſſed withal.</p>
                  <p>It Remains that I now make ſome Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whether thoſe that are born monſters have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153810:28"/>reaſonable Souls; and are capable of a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: And here both Divines and Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are generally of Opinion, That thoſe who accordig to the Orders of Generation, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from our firſt Parents, and proceeded by natural means from either Sex, tho' their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shape may be deformed and monſtrous, have notwithſtanding a reaſonable Soul, and conſequently their Bodies are capable of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as other Mens and VVomens are: But thoſe monſters that are not begotten by men, but are the product of a womans Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Luſt, in copulating with other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhall Periſh as the brute beaſts, by whom they were begotten, not having a reaſonable Soul, or any breath of the Almighty infuſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In the School of Nature we are taught the contrary, viz. <hi>That Like begets like;</hi> therefore of a Devil cannot Man be born.

And in a word, as there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Embraces of a Harlot, ſo there is no joy greater than in the reciprocal affection, and indearing Embraces of a loving, Obedient, and Chaſte Wife; nor is that the principal end for which Matrimouy was Ordained, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Man might follow the Great Law of his Creation, by the increaſe of his Kind, and repleniſhing the Earth: For this was an Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction laid upon him even in Paradice before his Fall.

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Errors in Marriage, what they are, and the Prejudice of them.</head>
                  <p>BY Errors in <hi>Marriage, I</hi> mean the Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Perſons <hi>Marrying,</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſtate; and that both with reſpect to their years, and the Conſtitution of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and therefore thoſe that deſign to enter into that Condition, ought to obſerve their <hi>Ability,</hi> and not run themſelves upon Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies; for thoſe who marry too young, may rightly be termed to marry unſeaſonably; not conſidering their Inability, nor examining the force of <hi>Nature:</hi> For divers there are, before they are ripe for the Conſummation of ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a matter, who either raſhly of their own accords, or by the inſtigation of Procurers and Marriage-brokers, or elſe forced thereto by their Parents, who covet a large Dowry, take upon them this Yoke, to their great prejudice; by which means ſome before the expiration of a year, have been thereby ſo enfeebled, that all their vital moiſture was exhauſted, and who have not been reſtored again without great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the uſe of Medicines. Wherefore my Advice is, That it is no way convenient to ſuffer Children, or ſuch as are not of age, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153810:32"/>marry or get Children: But whoſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on enough. That of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camena</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> is much to the purpoſe, where a young Woman is brought in, ſaying, <hi>I take not that to be my Dowry, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>'Tis certainly the Duty of Parents to be careful in bringing up their Children in the ways of Vertue; and to have regard to their Honour and Reputation, and eſpecially of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ns,</hi> when grown up to be marriageable: For, as has been before noted, if through the too much ſeverity of Parents, they be croſſed in their love, many of them throw themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unchaſte arms of the next alluring Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter that comes in their way; being through the ſoftneſs and flexibility of their Natures, and the ſtrong Deſires they have to purſue what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture powerfully incites them to, eaſily induced to believe mens feigned vows of promis'd mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153810:33"/>to cover their ſhame; and then too late their Parents repent of that ſeverity which has brought an indelible ſtain upon their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                  <p>Another Error in Marriage is the Inequality of years in the Parties married; ſuch as for a young man, who to advance his Fortune, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a Woman old enough to be his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, between whom, for the moſt part, Strifes, Jealouſies, and Diſcontents, are all the Bleſſings crown the Genial Bed, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for ſuch to have any Children. The like may be ſaid, though with a little more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, when an old doting Fellow marries a young <hi>Virgin,</hi> in the prime of her youth and vigour, who whilſt he vainly ſtrains to pleaſe her, is thereby wedded to his Grave. For as in green Youth 'tis unfit and unſeaſonable to think of Marriage, ſo to marry in Old Age is altogether the ſame: For they that enter upon it too ſoon, are ſoon exhauſted, and fall into Conſumptions, and divers other Diſeaſes; and thoſe that procraſtinate, and marry unſeemly, fall into the like ill conveniencies on the other ſide, having only this Honour, of old Men they become young Cuckolds; eſpecially if their Wives have not been trained up in the Paths of Vertue, and lie too much open to the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and temptation of lewd and debauched men. And thus much for the Errors of raſh, inconſiderate and unſeaſonable Marriages.</p>

                  <p>MAny bitter Quarrels happen between Men and their Wives, upon the Man's ſuſpition that his wife comes too ſoon; and by Conſequence that he could not be the Father, whereas it was only want of Underſtanding the ſecrets of Nature that brought the Man into that Error; and which had he known, might have cur'd him of his Jealouſie and ſuſpition.

                  <p>THe Green Sickneſs is ſo common a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Virgins, eſpecially ſuch as are of a Flegmatick Complexion, that 'tis eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, ſhewing it ſelf by diſcolouring the Face, making it look green, pale, and of a dusky yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ghs, Legs, and Anckles, all above the Heels: And alſo there is a Wearineſs of the whole Body, without any reaſon for it.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:153810:36"/>
                  <p>The Galennical Phyſitians affirm, that this Diſtemper proceeds chiefly from the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Veſſels that are about the Womb, occaſion'd by the abundance of groſs, viſcous and and crude Humours, ariſing from ſeveral inward cauſes; but there are alſo outward cauſes, which have a ſhare in the Production of it, as taking cold on the Feet, drinking of Water, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in Diet, and alſo the eating of things contrary to Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> raw, or burnt Fleſh, Aſhes, Coals, Old ſhoes, Chalk, Wax, Nut-ſhels, Mortar, Lime, Oat-meal, Tobacco Pipes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which occaſion not only a Suppreſſion of the <hi>Menſes,</hi> but likewiſe obſtructions through the whole Body. Therefore the firſt thing neceſſary to eradicate the Cauſe, is, <hi>Matrimonial</hi> Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſuch Copulation that may prove to the ſatisfaction of her that is afflicted; for by that means the <hi>menſes</hi> will begin to flow accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their natural and due courſe; and the <hi>Humours,</hi> being diſperſed, will ſoon waſte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then no more matter being admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to increaſe them, they will vaniſh, and a good temperament of Body will return: But in caſe this beſt Remedy cannot be had ſo ſoon as neceſſity requries, then let her be let Blood in the Ankle and if ſhe be about 16, you may likewiſe do it in the Arm, but let her bleed but ſparingly, eſpecially if the Blood be good. If the Diſeaſe be of any continuance then is it to be eradicated by Purging, <hi>Preparation</hi> of the <hi>humour</hi> being firſt conſider'd, which may be done
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153810:37"/>by the Virgins drinking Decoction of <hi>Guaicum,</hi> with <hi>Dittany</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> But the beſt <hi>Purge</hi> in this caſe ought to be made of <hi>Aloes, Agarick, Senna, Rhubarb:</hi> And for ſtrengthing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, and opening Obſtructions, <hi>Chalibiat, Medicines</hi> are chiefly to be uſed. The Diet muſt be moderate, and ſharp things be by all means avoided. And for the freeing of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> take Prepared Steel, Bezoar Stone, the Root of Scorzonera, Oyl of Chryſtal in ſmall Wine, and let the Diet be moderate, but in no wiſe let Vinegar be uſed therewith, nor upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other occaſion. And in ſo obſerving, the Humours will be dilated and diſſipated, by which Means the Complexion will return, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be lively and full of Vigour.</p>
                  <p>And now ſince Barrenneſs daily occaſions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and that Diſcontent creates Difference between Man and Wife, or by immoderate Grief frequently caſts the Woman into one or other violent Diſtemper; I ſhall in the next place treat thereof.</p>

                     <p>In times paſt, before Women came to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Bed, they were firſt ſearched by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife; and thoſe only which ſhe allowed of as fruitful, were admitted. I hope therefore it will be thought a needleſs labour, to ſhew how they may prove themſelves, and turn the ſtony ground into a fruitful ſoil.</p>
                     <p>Barrenneſs is a deprivation of life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153810:37"/>which ought to be in the ſeed, to procreate and propagate; for which end both man and woman were made.</p>

                     <head>Cauſes of Barrenneſs.</head>
                     <p>It is cauſed by overmuch heat or cold; that drying up the ſeed, and making it corrupt; this, extinguiſhing the life of the ſeed, making it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſh and unfit for Generation. It may be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo by the not flowing or over-flowing of the Courſes, by Swellings, Ulcers and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Womb; by an excreſcence of fleſh growing about the mouth of the Matrix: by the mouth of the Womb being turned unto the back, or ſide: by the groſsneſs and fatneſs of the body, whereby the mouth of the matrix is cloſed up, by being preſt with the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Caule; and the matter of the ſeed is converted into fatneſs. Or if ſhe be of a lean and exhauſt body, to the World ſhe proves Barren, becauſe though ſhe doth conceive, yet the fruit of the Womb will wither before it comes to perfection for want of nouriſhment. <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Sylvius,</hi> aſcribe one main cauſe of Barrenneſs to compel'd copulation; as when parents enforce their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to have Husbands contrary to their liking, therein marrying their Bodies, but not their Hearts, and where there is a want of Love, there for the moſt part is no Conception; as appears in Women which are deflowred againſt their will. Another main cauſe of Barrenneſs, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the want of a convenient moderating
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153810:38"/>quality, which the Woman ought to have with the Man, as if he be hot, ſhe muſt be cold: If he be dry, ſhe muſt be moiſt: But if they be both dry, or both moiſt of conſtitution, they cannot propagate; and yet ſimply conſidered, of themſelves they are not Barren; for he or ſhe which before was as the Barren fig-tree, being now joined with an apt conſtitution, becomes as the fruitful Vine. And that Man and Woman being every way of a like conſtitution, cannot Procreate, I will bring Nature it ſelf for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, who hath made Man of a hotter Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution than Woman, that the quality of the one may moderate the quality of the other.</p>

                     <p>If Barrenneſs does proceed from overmuch heat, ſhe is of a dry body, ſubject to anger, ſhe hath black Hair, quick pulſe; her purgations flow but little, and that with pain; ſhe Loves to play in the courts of <hi>Venus.</hi> But if it comes by cold, then are the ſigns contrary to thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now recited.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153810:38"/>extinguiſht, or through heat diſſipated. If any Woman be ſuſpected to be unfruitful, caſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> ſuch as is digged out of the Mine, into her Urin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The apteſt time for Conception is inſtantly after the <hi>Menſes</hi> are ceas'd, becauſe then the Womb is thirſty and dry, apt both to draw the Seed, and to retain it, by the roughneſs of the inward ſuperficies. And beſides, in ſome, the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153810:41"/>mouth of the Womb is turned unto the back or ſide, and is not placed right, until the laſt day of the Courſes.</p>
                     <p>Exceſs in all things is to be avoided: Lay aſide all Paſſions of the Mind: Shun Study and Care, as things that are Enemies to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for if a Woman conceives under ſuch circumſtances, how wiſe ſoever the Parents are, the Children at the beſt will be but fooliſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the animal Faculties of the Parents, <hi>viz.</hi> the Underſtanding and the reſt (from whence the Child derives its Reaſon) are, as it were confuſed, through the multiplicity of Cares and Cogitations.

                  <p>Virginity, in a ſtrict ſence, does ſignifie the <hi>Prime,</hi> the <hi>Chief,</hi> the <hi>Beſt</hi> of any thing, which makes men ſo deſirous of marrying Virgins; imagining ſome greater pleaſure to be enjoy'd in their Embraces, than in thoſe of Widows, or ſuch as have before been lain withal: Tho' not many years ago, a very great Perſon was of another mind, and thought (to uſe his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) <hi>that the getting of a Maidenhead was ſuch a piece of Drudgery, as was more proper for a Porter than a Prince;</hi> but this was only his Opinion, for moſt Men, I am ſure, have other Sentiments. But to our purpoſe,</p>
                  <p>The curious Enquirers into Natures Secrets, have obſerved that in young Maids, in the <hi>Sinus Pudoris,</hi> or in that place that is called the Neck of the Womb, is that pendulous production vulgarly called the <hi>Hymen,</hi> but more rightly the <hi>Clauſtrum Virginale,</hi> and in French the <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton de Roſe,</hi> or Roſes Bud; becauſe it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153810:42"/>the Bud of a Roſe expanded, or a Clove-gilliflower, from whence it derived the word <hi>Defloro,</hi> to Deflower; and hence taking away of Virginity, is called Deflowering a Virgin; moſt being of opinion, that the Virginity is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together loſt, when this Duplication is fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and diſſipated by violence; and when it is found perfect and intire, no penetration has been made. And it is the opinion of ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſitians, that there is not either <hi>Hymen</hi> or <hi>Skin</hi> expanded containing Blood in it, which divers imagine in the firſt Copulation flows from the fractured Expanſe.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Clauſtrum Virginale,</hi> or Flower, is compoſed of four Caruncles, or little Buds like Myrtle-berries, which is Virgins are full and plump, but in Women flag and hang looſe; and theſe are placed in the four Angles of the <hi>Sinus Pudoris,</hi> joyned together by little Membranes, and Ligatures like Fibres, each of them ſituate in the Inteſticles or ſpaces between each Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, with which in a manner they are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably diſtended, which Membranes being once defacerated, denote Devirgination; and many inquiſitive and yet ignorant Perſons, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wives defective herein the firſt Night of their Marriage, have thereupon ſuſpected their Chaſtity, concluding another had been there before 'em. Now to undeceive ſuch, I do affirm, That ſuch Fracture may happen divers accidental ways, as well as by Copulation with Man, <hi>viz.</hi> By violent, ſtraining, coughing, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153810:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſneezing, ſtopping of Urine, and violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the veſſels, in forcibly ſending down the Humours, which preſſing for Paſſage, break the Ligatures or Membrane, ſo that the intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or fracture of that which is commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the <hi>Virginity</hi> or <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſign of Diſhoneſty; tho' certain it is, that 'tis more frequently broke in Copulation, than by any other means.</p>
                  <p>I have heard that at an Aſſize held in <hi>Rutland,</hi> a young Man was try'd for a Rape, in forcing a <hi>Virgin,</hi> when after divers queſtions asked, and the Maid ſwearing poſitively to the matter, naming the time, place, and manner of the action, it was upon mature deliberation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that ſhe ſhould be ſearched by a skilful Chyrurgeon, and two Midwives, who were to make their Report upon their Oaths, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due Examination they accordingly did, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Membranes were intire, and not dilacerated, and that it was their Opinion for that Reaſon, that her Body had not been penetrated, which ſo far wrought with the Jury, that the Priſoner was acquitted; and the Maid afterward confeſſed ſhe ſwore againſt him out of Revenge, he having promiſed to marry her, and afterwards declined it: And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning <hi>Virginity.</hi>

                  <p>This point is of much neceſſity, by reaſon of the different Opinions of Men relating to it. Therefore before any thing poſitive can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, it will be altogether convenient to recite what has been delivered, as well in the negative, as the affirmative. And firſt, <hi>Severus Plineus,</hi> who argues for the negative, writes thus: The Genital parts of both Sexes, are ſo unlike o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Subſtance, Compoſition, Situation, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Action and Uſe, that nothing is more unlike; and by how much all other parts of the Body, (the Breaſts excepted, which in Women ſwell more, becauſe Nature ordain'd 'em for ſuckling the Infant) have an exact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, ſo much the more do the Genital parts of one Sex, compared with the other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and if their Figure be thus different, much more is their uſe. The Venereal Appetite alſo proceeds from different cauſes; for in Men it proceeds from a deſire of Emiſſion, and in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from a deſire of Reception, in Women alſo the chiefeſt of thoſe parts are concave, and apt to receive, but in Men they are only porous</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (added he) how any one can imagine that the Genital Member of Female Births ſhould be chang'd into thoſe that belong to Males) ſince by thoſe parts only the diſtinction of Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es is made, nor can I well impute the reaſon of this vulgar Error to any thing but the miſtake of unexpert Midwifes, who have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the evil conformation of the parts which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153810:43"/>in ſome Male Births may have happened to have had ſome ſmall protruſion, not to have been diſcerned, as appear'd by the example of a Child Chriſtened at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Joan,</hi> as a Girl, which afterwards proved a Boy; and on the contrary, the over-far extenſion of the <hi>Clytoris</hi> in Female Births may have occaſioned the like miſtakes Thus far <hi>Pliny</hi> proceeds in the Negative, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what he has ſaid, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned Phyſicians that have aſſerted the affirmative, of which number <hi>Galen</hi> is one, <hi>A Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is different from a Woman in nothing elſe, but having his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nital Members without his Body, whereas a Woman has 'em within:</hi> And this is certain, That if Nature having formed a Man, would convert him into a Woman, ſhe hath no other Task to perform, but to turn his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nital Member inward; and ſo to turn a Woman into a Man by the contrary Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But this is to be underſtood of the Child, when it is in the Womb, and not perfectly formed; for divers times Nature hath made a Female Child, and it has ſo remain'd in the Womb of the Mother for a Month or two, and afterward plenty of Heat increaſing in the Genital Members, they have iſſued forth, and the Child has become a Male, yet retaining ſome certain Geſtures, unbefitting the Maſculine Sex, as Female Actions, a ſhrill Voice, and a more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153810:44"/>Effeminate temper than ordinary. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, Nature having often made a Male, and cold Humours flowing to it, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals have been inverted, yet ſtill retaining a Maſculine Air, both in voice and geſture.</p>
                  <p>Now tho' both theſe Opinions are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral Reaſons, yet I eſteem the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more agreable to Truth: For there is not that vaſt difference between the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the two Sexes, as <hi>Pliny</hi> would have us believe there is, for the Woman has in a manner the ſame Members with the Man, tho' they appear not outwardly, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted for the conveniency of Generation, the chief difference being, that one is ſolid, and the other porous; and that the principal Reaſon of changing Sexes is, and muſt be, attributed to heat or cold, ſuddenly, or ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted, which operates according to its greater or leſſer force.</p>

                  <p>A Midwife that would acquit her ſelf well in her Employment, ought by no means to enter upon it raſhly or unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly, but with all imaginable caution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153810:44"/>that ſhe is accountable for all the miſchief that befalls thro' her wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or neglect; therefore let none take upon them this Office, barely upon pretence of their maturity of Years and Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for in ſuch, for the moſt part, there are divers things wanting that ought to be obſerved, which is the occaſion ſo many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children are loſt: Now as for a Midwife, in relation to her Perſon, theſe things ought to be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> She muſt neither be too old nor too young, neither extraordinary fat, nor weakned by leanneſs, but in a good habit of Body, not ſubject to Diſeaſes, Fears, nor ſudden Frights; her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well ſhaped, and neat in her Attire, her Hands ſmooth and ſmall, her Nails ever pared ſhort, not ſuffering any Rings to be upon her Fingers during the time ſhe is doing her Office, nor any thing upon her Wriſts that may obſtruct; and to theſe ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Activity, and a convenient Strength, with much caution and diligence; not ſubject to Drowſineſs nor apt to be Impatient.</p>
                  <p>As for her Manners, ſhe ought to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, affable, ſober, chaſte, and not ſubject to paſſion; bountiful and compaſſionate to the Poor, and not covetous when ſhe attends upon the Rich.</p>
                  <p>Her Temper chearful and pleaſant, that ſhe may the better comfort her patients in their dolorous Labour; nor muſt ſhe at any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:153810:45"/>time make over-much haſte, tho' her Buſineſs ſhould require her in another place, leſt ſhe do thereby endanger the Mother or the Child.</p>
                  <p>Of Spirit ſhe ought to be wary, prudent, and cunning: But above all, the fear of God ought to have the Aſcendant in her Soul, which will give her both Knowledge and Diſcretion, as the wiſe man tells us.</p>

                  <p>SInce the Office of a Midwife has ſo great an influence upon the well or ill doing of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, In the firſt place let her be diligent to acquire whatever Knowledge may be advantagious to her Practice, never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf ſo perfect, but that ſhe may add to her Knowledge by Study and Experience, yet never let her make any Experiments at her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients coſt, nor apply any Remedies in that caſe, unleſs ſhe has either try'd them, or knows that they'll do no harm, practiſing neither upon Poor nor Rich, but ſpeaking freely what ſhe knows; and by no means preſcribing ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as will cauſe Abortion, tho' deſired, which is a high degree of wickedneſs, and may be termed Murder. If ſhe be ſent for by them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:153810:45"/>ſhe knows not, let her be very cautious ere ſhe goes, leſt by laying an Infectious Woman, ſhe endanger the ſpoiling of others, as ſometimes happens. Neither muſt ſhe make her Houſe a Receptacle for great belly'd Women to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Burdens in, leſt her Houſe get an ill Name, and ſhe thereby loſe her Practice.</p>
                  <p>In laying of Women, if the Birth happen to be hard and difficult, ſhe muſt not ſeem to be concern'd, but muſt chear up the Woman, and do what ſhe can to make the labour eaſie, for which ſhe may find Directions in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this Book.</p>
                  <p>She muſt never think of any thing but doing well, cauſing all things to be in a readineſs, that are proper for the Work, and the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Woman, and receiving of the Child. And above all, let her take care to keep the woman from being unruly when her throes are coming upon her, leſt ſhe thereby endanger her own Life and the Childs.</p>
                  <p>She muſt alſo take care ſhe be not too haſty in her buſineſs, but wait Gods leiſure for the Birth: And by no means let her ſuffer herſelf to be diſorder'd by fear, though things ſhould not go well, leſt it ſhould make her uncapable of giving that aſſiſtance which the labouring woman ſtands in need of; for when we are moſt at a loſs, then there is moſt need of prudence to ſet things right.</p>
                  <p>And now becauſe ſhe can never be a skilful Midwife, that knows nothing but what is to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153810:46"/>be ſeen outwardly, I ſhall not think it amiſs, but on the contrary highly neceſſary, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to deſcribe the Generative Parts of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as they have been Anatomized by the Learned, and ſhew the uſe of ſuch Veſſels as are contributing to Generation.</p>

                  <p>IF it were not for Publick Benefit, eſpecially of the Practitioners and Profeſſors of the Art of Midwifery, I ſhould forbear to treat of theſe Secrets of Nature, becauſe they may be turned by ſome laſcivious and lewd Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ridicule, but they being abſolutely neceſſary to be known, in order to a publick Good, I will not omit them, becauſe ſome may make a wrong uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe parts that offer themſelves to view at the bottom of the Belly, are the <hi>Fiſſura Magna,</hi> or the Great Chink, with its <hi>Labia,</hi> or Lips, the <hi>Mons Veneris,</hi> and the Hair.

                     <hi>Anus:</hi> But it is leſs and cloſer in Maids, than in thoſe that have born Children; and has two Lips, which towards the <hi>Pubes,</hi> grow thicker and more full, and meeting upon the middle of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> make that riſing Hill, that is called <hi>Mons Veneris,</hi> or the Hill of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing that offers are the <hi>Nymphae</hi> and <hi>Clytoris,</hi> the former of which is of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brany and filmy Subſtance, ſpongy, ſoft, and partly fleſhy, of a red colour, in the ſhape of wings, two in number, tho' from their riſe they are joyned in an acute Angle, producing there a fleſhy Subſtance, which cloaths the <hi>Clytoris,</hi> and ſometimes they ſpread ſo far, that Inciſion is required to make way for the Mans Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Generation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Clytoris</hi> is a ſubſtance in the upper part of the Diviſion, where the two wings concur, and is the Seat of Venereal Pleaſure, being like a Yard in Situation, Subſtance, Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Erection, growing ſometimes out of the Body two inches, but that never happens, unleſs through extream luſt, or extraordinary accident. This <hi>Clytoris</hi> conſiſts of two ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and skinny Bodies, containing a diſtinct Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> the Head of it being covered with a tender skin, having a hole or paſſage like the <hi>Penis,</hi> or Yard of a Man, tho' not quite through, in which and the bigneſs, it only differs from it.</p>
                  <p>The next thing in courſe are the fleſhy Knobs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:153810:47"/>and the great Neck of the <hi>Womb:</hi> And theſe Knobs are behind the <hi>Wings,</hi> being four in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and reſemble Myrtle-Berries, being placed Quadrangular, one againſt the other, and in this place is inſerted to the Orifice of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which opens it ſelf into the Fiſſures to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Urine, for ſecuring of which from Cold, or the like Inconveniency, one of theſe Knobs are placed before it, and ſhuts up the Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>The Lips of the <hi>Womb</hi> that next appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated, diſcloſe the Neck thereof, and in them two things are to be obſerved, which is, The Neck it ſelf, and the <hi>Hymen,</hi> but more properly the <hi>Clauſtrum Virginale,</hi> of which I have before diſcourſed. By the Neck of the <hi>Womb</hi> is to be underſtood the Channel that is between the aforeſaid Knobs, and the inner Bone of the <hi>Womb,</hi> which receives the <hi>Penis</hi> like a Sheath; and that it may the better be dilated for the pleaſure of Procreation, the ſubſtance of it is ſinewy, and a little ſpongy, and in this Concavity are divers Folds, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicular Plights, made by Tunicles, wrinkled like an expanded Roſe; in <hi>Virgins</hi> they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, but in women that have often uſed copulation they are extinguiſhed; ſo that the inner ſide of the <hi>Womb</hi>'s Neck appears ſmooth, and in old women it becomes more hard and griſly: But tho' this Channel be at ſometimes writhed and crooked, ſinking down, yet in the time of Copulation, Labour, or the Monthly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:153810:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Purgations, it is erected and extended, which over-extention occaſioneth the pains in Child-birth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hymen</hi> or <hi>Claustrum Virginale,</hi> is that which cloſes the Neck of the <hi>Womb;</hi> being (as <hi>I</hi> have before cited in the Chapter relating to Virginity) broken in the firſt Copulation, its uſe being rather to ſtay the untimely Courſes in Virgins, than to any other end; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when it is broke in Copulation, or by any other Accident, a ſmall quantity of Blood flows from it, attended wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h ſome little pain. From whence ſome obſerve, that between the duplicity of the two Tunicles which conſtitute the Neck of the Womb, there are many Veins and Arteries running along, and ariſing from the veſſels on both ſides the Thighs, and ſo paſſing into the Neck of the Womb, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, and the reaſon thereof is, for that the Neck of the Bladder requires to be filled with abundance of Spirits, thereby to be dilated for its better taking hold of the <hi>Penis,</hi> there being great heat required in ſuch motions, which becoming more intenſe by the Act of Frication, conſumes a conſiderable quantity of moiſture, in the ſupplying of which, large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are altogether neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe of the longneſs of theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels is, by reaſon the <hi>Menſes</hi> make their way through them, which often occaſions Women with Child to continue their Purgations; for tho' the Womb be ſhut up, yet the paſſage in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153810:48"/>the Neck of the Womb, through which theſe Veſſels paſs, are open: In this caſe there is further to be obſerved, that as ſoon as you penetrate the <hi>Pudendum,</hi> there appears two little Pits or Holes, wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Humour, which by being expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in time of Copulation, greatly delights the Woman.</p>

As for the Neck of the VVomb, it is of an exquiſite feeling, ſo that if it be at any time out of order by being troubled with a ſchirroſity, over-fatneſs, moiſture, or relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the VVomb is ſubjected thereby to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs: In thoſe that are with Child, there frequently ſtays a moiſt glutinous Matter in the entrance to facilitate the Birth; for at the time of delivery the Mouth of the Womb is opened to ſuch a wideneſs, as is conformable to the bigneſs of the Child, ſuffering an equal dilation from the bottom to the top.</p>
                  <p>As for the Preparatory or Spermatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in Women, they conſiſt of two Veins and two Arteries, not differing from thoſe in a Man, but only in their largeneſs and manner of inſertion; for the number of Veins and Arteries are both the ſame as in Men, the right Vein iſſuing from the trunk of the hollow Vein deſcending, and the left from the Emulgent Vein; and on the ſide of them are two Arteries, which grows from the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the length and breadth of theſe Veſſels, they are narrow, and ſhorter in Women than in Men; only obſerve they are more wreathed and contorted than in Men, as ſhrinking together, by reaſon of their ſhortneſs, that they may by their looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153810:49"/>be the better ſtretched out, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requires it. And theſe Veſſels in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are carried with an indirect courſe thro' the leſſer Guts, to the Teſticles but are in the mid-way divided into two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the greater going <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the Stones, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the various or winding Body, and wonderfully Inoculating; the leſſer Branch ending in the Womb, in the ſide of which it diſperſeth it ſelf, and eſpecially at the higher part of the bottom of the Womb, for its nouriſhment, and that part of the Courſes may purge through theſe Veſſels; and ſeeing the Teſticles in Women are ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the Womb, for that cauſe theſe Veſſels fall not from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make they much Paſſages as in Men, not extending themſelves to the ſhare-bone.</p>
                  <p>The Stones in Women, commonly called the Teſticles, perform not the ſame Action as in Men; they are alſo different in their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, bigneſs, temperament, ſubſtance, form and covering. As for the place of their ſeat, it is in the hollowneſs of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> neither are they pendulous, but reſt upon the Muſcles of the Loyns, that ſo they may, by contracting the greater heat, be more fruitful, their Office being to contain the <hi>Ova</hi> or Egg, which being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Mans Seed, ingenders Man; yet they differ from thoſe of Men in figure, by reaſon of their leſsneſs or flatneſs at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153810:50"/>each end, not being ſo round or oval. The external Superficies being likewiſe more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, appearing like the compoſition of a great many knots and kernels mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there is difference alſo in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they being much more ſoft and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, looſe, and not ſo well compacted</p>
                  <p>Their bigneſs and temperament being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe different, for they are much colder and leſſer than thoſe in Men; as for their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or incloſure, it differs extreamly; for as Men's are wrapped in divers Tunicles, by reaſon they are externally Pendulous, and ſubject to divers injuries, unleſs ſo fenced by Nature, ſo Women's Stones being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and leſs ſubject to caſualty, are covered with one Tunicle or Membrane, which though it cloſely cleave to them, yet are they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe half covered with the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ejaculatory Veſſels are two obſcure Paſſages, one on either ſide, nothing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the Spermatick Veins in ſubſtance; riſe they do, on one part from the bottom of the Womb, not reaching from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extremity, either to the Stones, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other part, but ſhut up and unpaſſable, adhering to the Womb as the Colon does to the blind Gut, and winding half way about; tho' the Teſticles are remote to them, and touch them not, yet they are tied to them by certain Membranes, reſembling the Wings of a Batt, through which certain
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153810:50"/>Veins and Arteries paſſing from the end of the Teſticles, may be termed here to have their Paſſages: proceeding from the corners of the Womb to the Teſticles, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the proper Ligaments by which the Teſticles and Womb are united, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knit together, and theſe Ligaments in VVomen, are the Cremaſters in Men; of which I ſhall ſpeak more largely, when I come to deſcribe the Maſculine parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Generation.</p>

                  <p>THe Externals, commonly called the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi> are deſigned to cover the great Orifice, and that to receive the <hi>Penis,</hi> or Yard in the act of Coition, and give paſſage to the Birth and Urine. The uſe of the Wings and Knobs like Mirtle-berries, are for the ſecurity of the Internal parts, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Orifice and Neck of the Bladder, and by their ſwelling up cauſe Titulation and delight in thoſe parts, and alſo to obſtruct the unvoluntary paſſage of the Urine.</p>
                  <p>The Action of the <hi>Clytoris</hi> in Women,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153810:51"/>is like that of the <hi>Penis</hi> in Men, <hi>viz.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: And its outer end is like the <hi>Glans</hi> of the <hi>Penis,</hi> and has the ſame Name. And as the <hi>Glans</hi> in Man is the Seat of the greateſt pleaſure in Copulation, ſo is this in Women, whence 'tis called <hi>Amoris dulcedo,</hi> and <hi>Aeſtrum Veneris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Action and Uſe of the Neck of the Womb is equal with that of the <hi>Penis, viz.</hi> Erection, occaſioned divers ways. For Firſt, In Copulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is erected and made ſtrait for the paſſage of the <hi>Penis</hi> to the Womb. Secondly, Whilſt the paſſage is repleated with Spirit and Vital Blood, it becomes more ſtrait for embracing the <hi>Penis:</hi> And as for the convenience of Erection it is twofold. Firſt, becauſe if the Neck of the Womb was not erected, the Yard could have no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient paſſage to the Womb. Secondly, it hinders any hurt or damage that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for the Veſſels that paſs through the Neck of the Womb, their Office is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh it with Blood and Spirit, that ſtill as the moiſture conſumes by the heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in Copulation, it may by thoſe Veſſels be renewed. But their chief buſineſs is, to convey Nutriment to the Womb.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Womb</hi> has many Properties attributed to it, as Firſt, Retention of the fecundated Egg, and this is properly called Conception.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:153810:51"/>
                  <p>Secondly, To cheriſh and nouriſh it, till Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has framed the Child, and brought it to perfection. And then it ſtrongly operates in ſending forth the Birth when the time of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there is expired, dilating it ſelf in a wonderful manner: And ſo aptly removed from the Senſes, that nothing of Injury can proceed from thence, retaining in it ſelf a power and ſtrength to operate and caſt forth the Birth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by accident it be render'd deficient; and then to ſtrengthen and enable it, Remedies muſt be applied by skilful Hands; Directions for the applying of which, ſhall be given in the <hi>Second Part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of the Preparing veſſels is this: The Arteries convey the Blood to the Teſticles, part whereof is ſpent in the nouriſhment of them, and the Production of thoſe little Bladders (in all things reſembling Eggs) through which the <hi>Vaſa Praeparantia</hi> run, and are obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153810:54"/>avoided; for it will allay the briskneſs of the Spirits, and render 'em dull and languid, and alſo hinders digeſtion, and ſo muſt needs be an Enemy to Copulation: For it is Food mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken that is well digeſted, and what is well digeſted creates good Blood, and good Blood makes good Spirits, and enables a Man without vigor and activity to perform the Dictates of <hi>Nature.</hi> It is alſo highly neceſſary that in their mutual Embraces they meet each other with an equal Ardour: For if their Spirits flag on either part, they will fall ſhort of what <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> requires; and the Woman either miſs of Conception, or elſe the Children prove weak in their Bodies, or defective in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.

                  <p>And when they've done what <hi>Nature</hi> does require, the Man muſt have a Care he does not part too ſoon from the Embraces of his Wife, leſt ſome ſudden interpoſing Cold ſhould ſtrike into the Womb, and occaſion a Miſcarriage, and thereby deprive them of the Fruit of their Labours.</p>
                  <p>And when after ſome ſmall convenient time the Man has withdrawn himſelf, let the Woman gently betake her ſelf to Reſt, with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ſerenity and compoſure of Mind, free

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the WOMB, in General.</head>
                  <p>ALTHO' in the firſt Part I have ſpoken ſomething of the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> yet being in this Second Part to Treat more Particularly thereof, and of the various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and Maladies it is ſubject to, I ſhall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153810:56"/>not think it a Tautology to give you by way of <hi>Introduction</hi> a general Deſcription both of its Situation and Parts, but rather think this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part would be imperfect without it, ſo that it can by no means be Omitted; eſpecially ſince in it I am to ſpeak of the Quality of the <hi>Menſtruous Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Touching the Womb: Of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> it is called <hi>METRA,</hi> the Mother; or <hi>DELPHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> ſaith <hi>Priſcian,</hi> becauſe it makes us all Brothers.</p>
                  <p>It is placed in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> or lower part of the Belly, in the Cavity called <hi>Pelvis,</hi> having the ſtreight Gut on one ſide to keep it from the hardneſs of the Back-bone; and the Bladder on the other ſide, to defend it from Blows. The form or figure of it is like a Viril Member, only this excepted, the Manhood is outward, and the Womanhood within.</p>
                  <p>It is divided into the Neck and the Body. The Neck conſiſts of a hard fleſhy Subſtance, much like a Cartilage; at the end whereof there is a <hi>Membrane</hi> tranſverſly placed, called <hi>Hymen,</hi> or <hi>Eugion.</hi> Near alſo unto the neck, there is a prominent Panicle, which is called of <hi>Montanus,</hi> the Door of the Womb, becauſe it preſerveth the Matrix from Cold and Duſt. Of the <hi>Graecians</hi> it is called <hi>KLYTORIS;</hi> of the <hi>Latines, Praeutium Muliebre,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Women did abuſe this part to their own mutual Luſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:153810:56"/>
                  <p>The Body of the Womb is that wherein the Child is Conceived; and this is not altogether round, but dilates it ſelf into two Angles, the outward part of it is Nervous, and full of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, which are the cauſe of its motion; but inwardly it is Fleſhy.</p>
                  <p>It is fabulouſly Reported, That in the cavity of the Womb there are ſeven divided Cells or Receptacles for Humane Seed. But thoſe that have ſeen Anatomies, do know there are but two, and likewiſe, that thoſe two are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by a Partition, but only by a Line, or Suture running through the midſt of it. In the right ſide of the Cavity, by reaſon of the heat of the Liver, Males are conceived. In the left ſide, by the coldneſs of the Spleen, Females are begotten. And this do moſt of our Moderns hold for an infallible Truth; yet <hi>Hypocrates</hi> holds it but in the General: For in whom <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the Spermatick Veſſel of the right ſide comes from the Reins, and the Spermatical Veſſel of the left ſide from the hollow <hi>Vein;</hi> in them Males are conceived in the left Side, and Females in the right. Well therefore may I conclude with the ſaying of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> Such ſometimes is the power of the Seed, that a Male may be conceived in the left Side, as well as in the right. In the bottom of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity there are little holes, called the <hi>Cotyledones,</hi> which are the ends of certain Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ſerving in breeding women, to convey Suſtenance to the Child, which is received by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153810:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Umbilical Vein; and others to carry the Courſes into the Matrix.</p>
                  <p>Now, touching the Menſtruals, they are Defined to be a Monthly flux of Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Unprofitable Blood.</p>
                  <p>In which we are to Note, That the matter flowing forth is Excrementitious; which is to be underſtood of the Superplus or Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of it: For it is an Excrement in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, in quality being pure and incorrupt, like unto the Blood in the <hi>Veins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the menſtrous Blood is pure, and ſimply of it ſelf, all one in quality with that in the veins, is proved two ways: Firſt, from the final Cauſe of this Blood, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and conſervation of Mankind; that Man might be conceived; and being begotten, he might be Comforted and Preſerved, both in the Womb, and out of the Womb. And all will grant it for a Truth, That the Child, while it is in the Matrix, is nouriſhed with this Blood; and it is as true, That being out of the Womb, it is ſtill nouriſhed with the ſame; for the Milk is nothing but the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Blood made white in the Breaſts; and I am ſure Womans Milk is not thought to be venemous, but of a nutritive quality, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the tender nature of an Infant. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is proved to be Pure from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of it, it being the Superfluity of the laſt Aliment of the fleſhy parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:153810:57"/>
                  <p>It may be Objected, If the Blood be not of a hurtful Quality, How can it cauſe ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Effects; as if the ſame fall upon Trees and Herbs, it maketh the one barren, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the other? And <hi>Averroes</hi> writes, That if a man accompany with a Menſtruous woman, if ſhe Conceive, ſhe ſhall bring forth a Leaper. I anſwer, this Malignity is contracted in the Womb, for the woman wanting native heat to digeſt this Superfluity, ſends it to the Matrix, where ſeating it ſelf until the mouth of the Womb be dilated, it becomes corrupt and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, which may eaſily be, conſidering the heat and moiſtneſs of the place. This Blood therefore being out of his veſſels, offends in quality: In this Senſe let us underſtand <hi>Pliny, Fernelius, Florus,</hi> and the reſt of that Torrent. But if Frigi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity be the cauſe why women cannot digeſt all their laſt Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently that they have theſe Purgations; it remains to give a reaſon why they are of ſo cold a Conſtitution more than Men; which is this:</p>
                  <p>The natural end of men and womens being, is to Propagate, and this Injunction was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them by God at their firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and again after the Deluge. Now in the act of Conception, there muſt be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and a Patient, for if they be both every way of one Conſtitution, they cannot Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate: Man therefore is Hot and Dry, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Cold and Moiſt; he is the Agent, ſhe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153810:58"/>the Patient, or weaker Veſſel, that ſhe ſhould be Subject unto the Office of the Man. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that woman ſhould be of a cold Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, becauſe in her is required a Redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of matter for the Infant depending on her: For otherwiſe, if there were not a Superplus of Nouriſhment for the Child, more than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Mother, then would the Infant Detract and weaken the principal parts of the Mother; and like unto the <hi>Viper,</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Infant would be the Deſtruction of the Parent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Monthly Purgations continue from the 15th Year to the 46th or 50th. Yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there happens a ſuppreſſion, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural, or Morbifical. They are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuppreſt in breeding women, and ſuch as give ſuck. The Morbifical ſuppreſſion falls now into our Method to be ſpoken of.</p>

                     <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The Cauſe of this Suppreſſion is either External or Internal. The External Cauſe may be heat or dryneſs of the Air, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate watching, great labour, vehement mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the matter is ſo conſumed, and the body ſo exhauſted, that there is not a Superplus remaining to be expelled; as is Recorded of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> who being active, and always in motion, had their Fluxions very little, or not at all. Or it may be cauſed by Cold, which is moſt frequent, making the Blood Viſcous and Groſs, condenſing and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Paſſages, that it cannot flow forth.</p>
                  <p>The Internal Cauſe is either Inſtrumental or Material, in the womb or in the blood.</p>
                  <p>In the womb it may be divers ways; by Apoſthumes Tumours, Ulcers, by the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the veins and paſſages, or by the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> or <hi>Kell</hi> in fat Bodies, preſſing the neck of the Matrix, but then they muſt have <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Zirbalis:</hi> for in mankind the Kell reacheth not ſo low.

The blood likewiſe may be conſumed, and conſequently the Terms ſtayed, by bleeding of the Noſe, by a flux of the Emerhoids, by a <hi>Dyſenteria,</hi> commonly called the bloody flux; by many other evacuations, and continual and chronical Diſeaſes. Secondly, the matter may be vitious in quality; as ſuppoſe it be Sanguineous, Phlegmatical, Byleous, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholious, every one of theſe, if they offend in Groſneſs, will cauſe an Obſtruction in the veins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signs.</hi> Signs manifeſting the Diſeaſe, are pains in the head, neck, back and loyns; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of the whole body, but eſpecially of the hips and legs, by reaſon of a Confinity which the Matrix hath with theſe parts; trembling of the heart. Particular ſigns are theſe; if the Suppreſſion proceeds of cold, ſhe is heavy, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, of a pale Colour, and hath a ſlow Pulſe, <hi>Venus</hi> combats are neglected, the Urin is crude, wateriſh, and much in quantity; the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Guts uſually are retained. If of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153810:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>heat, the ſigns are contrary to thoſe but now recited. If the retention be natural, and come of Conception, this may be known by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Hydromel,</hi> that is, water and honey, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper going to bed, and by the effect which it worketh; for, after the taking of it, if ſhe feels a beating pain about the Navel and lower parts of the Belly, it is a ſign ſhe hath Conceived, and that the Suppreſſion is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: if not, then is it vitious, and ought Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinally to be taken away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> With the evil quality of the Womb the whole body ſtands charged; but eſpecially the Heart, the Liver, and the Brain; and betwixt the Womb and theſe three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts, there is a ſingular Conſent. Firſt, the Womb communicates to the Heart by the mediation of thoſe Arteries which come from <hi>Aorta:</hi> Hence the Terms being ſuppreſt, will enſue Faintings, Swoonings, intermiſſion of Pulſe, ceſſation of Breath. Secondly, It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to the Liver by the veins derived from the hollow vein: Hence will follow Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bructions, Cachexies, Jaundice, Dropſies, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spleen. Thirdly, It communicates unto the Brain, by the nerves and membranes of the back: Hence will ariſe Epilepſies, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Frenzies, melancholy Paſſions, pain in the after-parts of the Head, fearfulneſs in ability of ſpeaking. Well therefore may I conclude with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> If the Months be ſuppreſt, many dangerous Diſeaſes will follow.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the overflowing of the Courſes.</head>
                  <p>THe Schoolmen ſay, By comparing of Contraries, Truth is made manifeſt. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore ſpoken of the ſuppreſſion of the terms; order requires now, that I ſhould inſiſt upon the overflowing of them, an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no leſs dangerous then the former. And this immoderate flux of the Months is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be a Sanguineous excrement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Womb, exceeding both in quantity and time. Firſt it is ſaid to be Sanguineous, the matter of the flux being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blood; wherein it differs from that which is commonly called the falſe courſes, or whites; of which I will ſpeak hereafter. Secondly it is ſaid to proceed from the Womb: for there are two ways by which the Blood flows forth. The one s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>by the internal Veins in the Body of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e Womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is properly called the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ux. The other is by thoſe Veins which are termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Neck of the Matrix and this is called of <hi>Aetius,</hi> the Hemorrhoides of the Womb. Laſtly it is ſaid to exceed both in quantity and time. In quantity ſaith <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> when they flow above 18 Ounces. In time, when they flow above three days. But we take this for a certain character of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153810:62"/>their inordinate flowing, when the faculties of the Body thereby are weakned. In Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies abounding with Groſs Humours, this immoderate flux ſometimes unburdens Nature of her Load, and ought not to be ſtayed without the counſel of a Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The cauſe of this affect is internal or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; The internal cauſe is threefold; in the matter, inſtrument, or faculty. The matter, which is the Blood, may be vitious two ways. Firſt, in quantity, it being ſo great that the Veins are not able to contain it. Secondly, in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it being aduſt, ſharp, watriſh or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted. The inſtrument, <hi>viz.</hi> the Veins are faulty by the dilatation of the Orifice; which may be cauſed two ways: firſt, by the heat of the conſtitution, climate or ſeaſon, heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood, whereby the paſſages are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the faculty weakned that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retain the Blood. Secondly, by falls, Blows, violent motion, breaking of a Vein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The external cauſe may be calidity of the air, lifting, carrying of heavy burdens, unnatural Child-Birth, falls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signs.</hi> In this inordinate flux the appetite is decayed, the concoctions depraved, and all the actions weakened, the feet are ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the colour of the Face is changed, and a general feebleneſs poſſeſſeth the whole Body. If the flux comes by the breaking of a vein, the Body is ſomething Cold, the Blood flows forth on heaps, and that ſuddenly, with great
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153810:63"/>pain. If it comes through heat, the Orifice of the veins being dilated, then is there little or no pain, yet the Blood flows faſter then it doth in an Eroſion ; and not ſo faſt as it doth in a Rupture. If by Eroſion, or ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Blood, ſhe feels a great heat ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſſage; It differs from the other two, in that it flows not ſo ſuddenly nor ſo copiouſly as they do. If by weakneſs of the Womb, ſhe abhorreth the uſe of <hi>Venus.</hi> Laſtly if it proceeds from an evil quality in the Blood; drop ſome of it on a Cloth, and when it is dry, you may judge of the quality by the Colour. If it be Cholerick, it will be Yellow; If Melancholy, Black; If Flegmatical, watriſh and whitiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> If with the flux be joyned a convulſion, it is dangerous, becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the more noble parts are vitiated; and a convulſion cauſed by emptineſs is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If it continues long it will be cured with great difficulty: for it was one of the miracles which our Saviour Chriſt wrought to cure this diſeaſe when it had continued 12 Years. To conclude, if the flux be inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, many diſeaſes will enſue; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, the Blood together with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat being conſumed, either cachectical Hydropical, or paralitical diſeaſes will follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cure.</hi> The cure conſiſteth in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Firſt, in repelling and carrying back of the Blood. Secondly, in correcting
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:153810:63"/>and taking away the fluxibility of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thirdly, in corroborating the veins and faculties. For the firſt; To cauſe a regreſſion of the Blood, open a vein in the Arm, and draw out ſo much blood as the ſtrength of the Patient will permit; and that not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but at ſeveral times; for hereby the ſpirits are the leſs weakned, and the retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo much the greater.</p>
                  <p>Apply cupping-glaſſes to the Breſts, and alſo to the Liver, that the reverſion may be in the Fountain.</p>
                  <p>To correct the fluxibility of the matter, Cathartical means, moderated with Aſtricto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>If it be cauſed by Eroſion, or ſharpneſs of blood; conſider whether the Eroſion be by ſalt Flegm, or aduſt Colour. If by ſalt Flegm, Prepare with ſyrup of violet? Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Roſes, Citron pills, Succory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then take this purgation following. Take Myrobolans, Chebul, half an Ounce, Trochisks of Agarick one dram, with Plantain water make a decoction: add thereunto ſir. roſat. lax. 3 Ounces, and make a potion.</p>
                  <p>If by aduſt Choller, prepare the Body with Syrrup of Roſes, Myrtles, Sorrel, Purſlain, commixt with water of Plantain, Knotgraſs, and Endive: Then purge with this potion: Take Rinds of Myrobolans, Rhubarb, of each one dram; Cinnamon 15 Grains; infuſe them one night in Endive water: Add to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153810:64"/>the ſtraining pulp of Tamarind, Caſſia, of each <hi>half an Ounce,</hi> Syrup of Roſes one Ounce, make a potion.</p>
                  <p>If the blood be watriſh and unconcoct, as it is in Hydropical Bodies, and flows forth by reaſon of the tenuity and thinneſs, to draw off the Water will be profitable. Purge with Agarick, Elaterium, and Coloquintida. Sweating is proper in this cauſe, for by it the matter offending is taken away, and the motion of the blood is carried to, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts. To procure ſweat, uſe Carduus water with Mithridate, or the decoction of Guaiacum Saſſafras, and Sarſa-parilla; the Gum of Guaiacum alſo doth greatly provoke ſweat, Pills of Sarſa-parilla taken every night going to bed, are worthily commended. If the blood flows forth from the opening or breaking of a vein, without any evil quality in its ſelf, then ought only Corroboratives to be applied; which is the laſt thing to be done in the cure of this inordinate flux.</p>
                  <p>Take of Bole-<hi>Armoniac</hi> one Scruple; <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Treacle one dram, old conſerve of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes half an Ounce; with ſyrup of Myrtles make an Electuary. Or if the flux hath continued long, Take of Maſtick 2 drams, Olibani, Troch. de Carabe of each one dram; Balauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum, one Scruple, make a pouder; with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Quinces make it into Pills; take one always before Meals. <hi>Take Lapidis Haema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titis Triti, of each</hi> 2 <hi>Scruples; Specierum Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſantali</hi>

                  <p>The Cauſe is in the faculty, inſtrument, or matter.

                  <p>THis Affect, (which ſimply Conſidered is none, but the cauſe of an Affect) is called in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Suffocation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not becauſe the Womb is Strangled, but for that it cauſeth the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an to be choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. It is a retraction of the Womb towards the <hi>Midriff</hi> and Stomach, which preſſeth and cruſheth up the ſame, that the inſtrumental cauſe of reſpiration, the <hi>Midriff,</hi> is Suffocated; which conſenting with the Brain, cauſeth the Animal Faculty, the efficient cauſe of Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, to be intercepted; whereby the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being Refrigerated, and the Actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, ſhe falls to the Ground, as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dead.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Hiſterical Paſſions ſome continue longer, ſome ſhorter. <hi>Rabby Moſes</hi> writes of ſome, which lay in the Paroxiſme of the Fit two days. <hi>Ruffius</hi> makes mention of one, which continued in the ſame Paſſion three days and three nights; and at the three days and revived. That we may learn by other mens harms to beware, I will give you one Example more. <hi>Paraeus</hi> writeth of a Woman in <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſudenly fell into a Uterine Suffocation, and appeared to the Judgment of Man as dead: her Freinds wondering at this her ſudden

                     </gap>iration of all the Spectators.</p>
                  <p>To the end therefore, you may diſtinguiſh the Living from the Dead, the Antients pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe three Experiments. The firſt, is to lay a light Feather to the Mouth, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it you may judge, whether the Patient be Living or Dead. The ſecond, is to place a Glaſs of Water on the Breſt, and if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to move, it betokeneth Life. The Third is to hold a pure Looking-glaſs to the Mouth and Noſe; and if the Glaſs appear thick with a little Dew upon it, it betokeneth Life. And theſe three Experiments are good, yet with this Caution, that you ought not to depend on them too much; for, though the Feather and the Water do not move, and the Glaſs continue pure and clear, yet it is not a neceſſary Conſequence that ſhe is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Life: For the motion of the Lungs, by which the Reſpiration is made, may be taken away that ſhe cannot Breathe, yet the Internal Tranſpiration of the Heat may remain, which is not manifeſted by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Breſt, or Lungs, but lyes Occult in the Heart and inward Arteries. Examples hereof we may have in the Fly and Swallow, which in the Cold of Winter, to the Ocular
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153810:70"/>Aſpect, ſeem Dead, Inanimate, and Breathe not at all; yet they Live by the Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Heat which is reſerved in the Heart and inward Arteries: therefore when the Summer approacheth, the internal Heat being Revocated to the outward parts, they are then again revived out of their Sleepy Extaſie.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Women therefore that ſeem to dye ſuddenly, and upon no evident Cauſe, let them not be committed unto the Earth until the end of three days, leſt the Living be Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for the Dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cure.</hi> The part affected is the Womb; of which there is a twofold Motion, Natural and Symptomatical. The Natural Motion, is when the Womb attracteth the Humane Seed, or excludeth the Infant or Secundine. The Symptomatical Motion, of which we are here to ſpeak, is a Convulſive drawing upward of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe uſually is in the Retention of the Seed, or in the Suppreſſion of the Months, cauſing a Repletion of corrupt Humours in the Womb; from whence proceeds a Flatulent Refrigeration, cauſing a Convulſion of the Ligaments of the Womb. And as it may come from Humidity or Repletion, being a Convulſion, it may be cauſed by Emptyneſs or Dryneſs. And laſtly, By Abortion, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Child-birth.</p>

                     <hi>Signs.</hi> At the approaching of the ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there is a paleneſs of the face, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the legs, ſhortneſs of breath, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity of the whole body, with a working up into the throat, and then ſhe falls down as one void both of ſenſe and motion.

It differs from the Epilepſie, in that the eyes are not wreſted, neither does any ſpumy froth come from the mouth; and that convulſive motion which ſometime is joyned to ſuffocations, is not ſo Univerſal, as it is in the Epilepſie, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this or that member is convulſt, and that without any vehement agitation.

<pb facs="tcp:153810:71"/>a forewarning of her fit. Yet it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but that a Sincope may be joyned with this ſuffocation. Laſtly, it is diſtinguiſht from the Lethargy by the pulſe, which in the one is great, and in the other little.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prognoſticks,</hi> If the diſeaſe hath its being from the corruption of the ſeed, it foretels more danger then if it proceeded from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the courſes; becauſe the ſeed is concocted, and of a purer quality, than the menſtruous blood; and the more pure being corrupted, becomes the more foul and filthy; as appears in Eggs, the pureſt nouriſhment, which vitiated, yield the noiſomeſt ſavour. If it be accompained with a Sincope, it ſhews nature is but weak, and that the ſpirits are almoſt exhauſt. But if ſneezing follows, it ſhews that the heat which was almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, doth now begin to return, and that Nature will ſubdue the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cure.</hi> In the Cure of this Affect, two things muſt be obſerved. Firſt, That during the time of the Pararoxiſm, Nature be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to expel thoſe malignant Vapours which binds up the Senſes, that ſhe may be recalled out of that Sleepy Extaſie. Secondly, That in the the intermiſſion of the Fit, proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines be applyed to take away the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>To ſtir up Nature, faſten Cupping-glaſſes to the Hips and Navel: apply Ligatures to the Thighs: rub the Extream parts with Salt, Vinegar, and Muſtard. Cauſe loud Clamours

                  <p>The Fit being over, proceed to the curing of the Cauſe. If it ariſe from the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Menſes,</hi> look the Cure in page 105.

Make an iſſue on the inſide of each leg, a handful breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the knee. Make Trochisks of Agarick, two ſcruples; wild Carrot-ſeed, Ligni Aloes, of each half a ſcruple; waſh'd Turpentine, three drams; with Conſerve of Anthos make a Bolus. <hi>Caſtor</hi> is of excellent uſe in this caſe, one dram of it being taken in White-wine; or you may make Pills of it, with Mithridate, and take 'em
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153810:73"/>going to Bed. Take of white Briony Root dried and cut after the manner of Carrots, one ounce; put it into a draught of Wine, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it by the Fire, and when it is warm drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.

                  <p>THe falling down of the womb is a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ligatures, whereby the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is carried backward, and in ſome hangs out in the bigneſs of an Egg: Of this there be two kinds, diſtinguiſh'd by a Deſcending and a Precipitation. The deſcending of the womb is, when it ſinketh down to the entrance of the Privities, and appears to the Eye either not at all, or very little. The precipitation is, when the womb like a Purſe is turned the inſide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and hangs betwixt the Thighs in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Cupping-glaſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The Cauſe is external or internal: The external cauſe is difficult Child-birth, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pulling away of the Secondine, raſhneſs and inexperience in drawing away of the Child, violent coughing, ſneezing, falls, blows, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavy burdens. The internal Cauſe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is over-much humidity flowing unto thoſe parts, hindring the operations of the womb, whereby the ligaments by which the womb is ſupported, are relax'd. The Cauſe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is referr'd to be in the retention of the Seed, or in the ſuppreſſion of their Monthly Courſes.</p>

                     <hi>Signs.</hi> The Arſe-gut and the Bladder often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are ſo cruſhed, that the paſſage of both the Excrements is hindred. If the Urine doth flow forth, it is white and thick; and the Midriff is moleſted, the loyns are grieved, the Privities pained, the Womb ſinks down to the entrance of the private parts, or elſe comes clean out.</p>

                     <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> This Grief poſſeſſing an old Woman, is cared with great difficulty, becauſe it weakens the Faculties of the Womb, and therefore tho' it be reduced into his proper place, yet upon every little illneſs, or indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it is ſubject to return; and ſo it is with the younger ſort, if the Diſeaſe be inveterate.

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Inflammation of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>THe Phlegmon, or Inflammation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, is a Tumour poſſeſſing the whole Womb, accompanied with unnatural heat, by obſtructions and gathering together of corrupt Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The Cauſe of this Affect is ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Months, repletion of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, immoderate uſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> often handling
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153810:75"/>of the Genitals, difficult Child-birth, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agitation of the Body, falls, blows; to which alſo may be added the uſe of ſharp Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, whereby not ſeldom the Womb is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. Cupping-glaſſes alſo faſtened to the <hi>Pubes</hi> and <hi>Hypogastrium</hi> draw the Humours to the Womb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signs.</hi> The Signs are Aguiſh humours, pains in the head and ſtomach, vomiting, coldneſs of the knees, convulſions of the neck, doting, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the heart; ſometimes there is a ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of breath, by reaſon of the heat which is communicated to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> or Midriff; the Breſts ſympathizing with the Womb, are pained and ſwelled. <hi>Particular Signs.</hi> If the fore-part of the Matrix be inflamed, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities are grieved, the Urine is ſuppreſt, or flows forth with difficulty: If the after part, the loyns and back ſuffer, the Excrements are retained: If the right ſide, the right hip ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, the right leg is heavy, ſlow to motion, in ſo much that ſometimes ſhe ſeems to hault. And ſo if the left ſide of the Womb be inflamed, the left hip is pained, and the left leg is weaker than the right: If the Neck of the Womb be affected, the Midwife putting up her Finger, ſhall feel the mouth, of it retracted and cloſed up, with a hardneſs about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> All Inflammations of the Womb are dangerous, if not deadly; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the total ſubſtance of the Matrix be inflamed. Yet they are leſs perilous, if they be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153810:76"/>in the Neck of the Womb. A f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cure.</hi> In the Cure, firſt, let the humours flowing to the Womb be repell'd; for effecting of which, after the Belly hath been looſened by cooling Clyſters, Phlebotomy will be needful; Open therefore a Vein in the Arm, and (if ſhe be not with Child) the day after ſtrike the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phena</hi> on both Feet: Faſten Ligatures and Cupping-glaſſes to the Arms; and rub the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Parts.</p>

Make Plaiſters of Plaintain, Linſeed, Barley-meal, Mellilot, Fenugreek, Whites of Eggs; and if the pain be vehement, add a little Opium. Foment the Genitals with the Decoction of Poppy-heads, Purſlain, Knot-graſs and Water-Lillies. Make Injections of Goats-Milk, Roſe-water, clarified Whey, with Honey of Roſes.

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Dropſie of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>THe Uterine Dropſie is an unnatural ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ellevated by the gathering together of wind or flegm in the cavity, membranes, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Womb, by reaſon of the debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the native heat, not digeſting the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment received, and ſo it turns into an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes are over-much cold and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Milt and Liver, immoderate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eating of crude meats; all which cauſing a repletion do ſuffocate the native heat: It may be cauſed likewiſe by the over-flowing of the Courſes, or by any other immoderate Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. To theſe may be added Abortions, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Phlegmons, and Schirroſities of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signs.</hi> The Signs of this Affect are theſe: The lower parts of the Belly, with the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, are puffed up and payned, the feet ſweell; the natural colour of the Face decays, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is depraved, and the heavineſſ of the whole Body concurs: If ſhe turns her ſelf in the Bed from one ſide to the other, a noiſe like flowing of water is heard. Water ſometimes comes from the Matrix. If the ſwelling be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153810:79"/>cauſed by wind, the Belly being hit by the hand ſounds like a Drum; the Guts rumble, and the wind breaks through the neck of the womb with a murmouring noiſe. This Affect may be diſtinguiſh'd from a true Conception many ways, as will appear by the Chapter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. It is diſtinguiſh'd from the general Dropſie, in that the lower parts of the Belly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e moſt ſwell'd. Again, in this the ſanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty appears not ſo hurtful, nor the Urine ſo pale, nor the Countenance ſo ſoon changed; neither are the ſuperiour parts ſo extenuated as in the general Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> This Affect foretells the total ruine of the natural functions, by that ſingular conſent the womb hath with the liver; and therefore that a Cachexia, or a general Dropſie will follow.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Mola, or Falſe Conception.</head>
                  <p>THis diſeaſe, is called of the Greeks <hi>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LE,</hi> and the cauſe of this denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken from the load or heavy weight of it, it being a Mole, or great lump of hard fleſh burdening the Womb.</p>
                  <p>It is defined to be an inarticulate piece of fleſh without form, begotten in the Matrix, as it were a true Conception: In which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition we are to note two things. Firſt, in that a Mole is ſaid to be inarticulate, and without form, it differs from Monſters, which are both <hi>Formata</hi> and <hi>Articulata.</hi> Secondly, it is ſaid to be, as it were, a true
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153810:80"/>Conception, which puts a difference between a true Conception and a Mole; which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference holds good three ways. Firſt, in the Genus, in that a Mole cannot be ſaid to be animal. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>condly, in the Species, becauſe it hath no humane figure, and bears not the Character of a man. Thirdly, in the <hi>Individuum,</hi> for it hath no affinity with the Parent, either in the whole Body, or any Particle of the ſame</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe.</hi> About the cauſe of this affect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt learned Authors I find variety of Judgements. Some are of opinion, that if the Womans ſeed goes into the Womb and not the Mans, thereof is the Mole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Others there be that affirm it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of the menſtruous Blood: But if theſe two were granted, then Maids by having their Courſes, or through nocturnal polutions might be ſubject unto the ſame, which never any yet were. The true cauſe of this fleſhy Mole proceeds both from the Man, and from the Woman, from corrupt or Barren Seed in the Man, and from the menſtruous Blood in the Woman both mixed together in the Cavity of the Womb; where Nature finding her ſelf weak (yet deſiring to maintain the perpetuity of her Spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Signs.</hi> The ſigns of a Mole are theſe. The Months are ſuppreſt, the appetite is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, the breſts ſwell, and the Belly is puffed up and waxeth hard. Thus far the ſigns of a breeding Woman, and of one that beareth a Mole, are all one; I will now ſhew you how they differ.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſign of difference is taken from the motion of a Mole; it may be felt to move in the Womb before the third Month, which the Infant cannot: Yet that motion cannot be underſtood of any intelligent power in the Mole, but of the faculty of the Womb, and of the ſeminal Spirits diffuſed through the ſubſtance of the Mole; for it lives not a life animal, but vegitative in the manner of a Plant. Secondly, in a Mole, the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſuddenly puft up; but in a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the belly is firſt retracted, and then riſeth again by degrees. Thirdly, the belly being preſt with the hand, the Mole gives way; and the hand being taken away, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the place again: But a Child in the Womb, though preſt with the hand, moves not preſently; and being removed, returns ſlowly, or not at all. Laſtly, the Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the Womb not above Eleven Months; but a Mole continues ſome times four or five Years, more or leſs, according as it is faſtened in the Matrix. I have known when a Mole hath fallen away in four or five Months.</p>
                  <p>If it remains until the Eleventh Month,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:153810:81"/>the legs wax feeble, and the whole body conſumes; only the ſwelling of the belly ſtill increaſeth, which makes ſome think they are Hydropical, though there be little reaſon for it; for in the Dropſie le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſwell and grow big, but in a Mole they conſume, and wither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> If at the delivery of a Mole the Flux of Blood be great, it ſhews the more danger; becauſe the parts of nutrition having been vitiated by the flowing back of the ſuperfluous humours, whereby the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat is conſumed, and then parting with ſo much blood, the Woman thereby is ſo weakned in all her facult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, that ſhe can hardly ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cure.</hi> We are taught in the School of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that Phlebotomy cauſeth abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by taking away that nouriſhment, which ſhould ſuſtain the life of the Child. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this vitious Conception may be deprived of that vegetative ſap by which it lives; open the liver vein, and then the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phena</hi> on both feet. Faſten Cupping glaſſes to the loins and ſides of the belly: which done, let the Uterine parts be firſt Mollified, and then the expulſive faculty provoked to expel the burden.</p>
                  <p>To laxate the Ligatures of the Male; Take Mallows with the roots, 3 handfuls; <hi>Camomile, Melilote,</hi> Pellitory of the wall, Violet leaves, Mercury, Roots of Fennel, Parſley, of each 2 handfuls, Line-ſeed, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153810:82"/>of each one pound, boyl them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and let her ſit therein up to the Navel. At the going out of the Bath, Anoint the Privities and Reins with this Unguent follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Take oyl of Camomile, Lillies, and ſweet Almonds, of each one Ounce; freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Labdani, Ammoniaci, of each half an Ounce; with the Oyl of Lineſeed, make an Unguent. Or inſtead of this, may be uſed Unguentum Agrippae, or Dialthaea. Take of Mercury, Roots of Althea, of each half a handful; Fol. Branchae Urſinae, half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Lineſeed, Barley-meal, of each 6 ounces; boyl all theſe with Water and Honey, and make a Plaiſter. Make Peſſaries of the Gum Galbanum, Bdelium, Ammoniacum, Figs, Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuet, and Honey.</p>
                  <p>After the ligaments of the Mole are looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; let the expulſive faculty be ſtirred up to expell the Mole; for effecting of which, all Medicaments may be uſed which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to bring down the Courſes. Take Troch de Myrrha one Ounce, Caſtor, Ariſtolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Gentians, Dictam, of each half an ounce; make a Pouder, take one dram in 4 ounces of Mugwort water. Take of Hypericon, Calamint, Penny-royal, Bettony, Hyſſop, Sage, Horehound, Valerian, Madder, Savine, with water make a decoction, take 3 ounces of it, with one ounce and half of Syrup of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfew.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153810:82"/>Penny-royal, Saggapenum, Opopanax, of each half a dram; Aſſafoetida, Cinnamon, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-berries, Borage, of each one dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Make Inſeſſions of Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, Bay-leaves, Aſſrum, Calamint, Bay-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Camomile, Mugwort, Savine. Take of Sagapenum, Marjoram, Gentian, Savine, Cloves, Nutmeg, Bay-berries, of each 2 Scruples; Galbanum one dram, Hierae Picrae, Black Hellebore, of each one Scruple; with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine make a Peſſary. But if theſe things prove not available; then muſt the Mole be drawn away with an inſtrument put up into the Womb, called a <hi>Pes Griphius;</hi> which may be done with no great danger, if it be performed by a skilful Chirurgeon.</p>
                  <p>After the delivery of the Mole (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Woman hath parted with much blood already) let the flux of blood be ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſoon as may be.</p>
                  <p>Faſten Cupping-glaſſes to the ſhoulder, and ligatures to the arms. If theſe help not; open the Liver-vein on, the right arm.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Signs of Conception.</head>
                  <p>IGnorance makes Women become Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Fruit of their own Bodies; many having Conceived, and thereupon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Bodies to be out of Order, and not knowing rightly the Cauſe, do either run to the Shop of their own Conceit, and take what they think fit; or elſe (as the Cuſtom is) they ſend to the Phyſitian for Cure; and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving not the Cauſe of their Grief, (ſeeing that no certain Judgment can be given by the Urine) preſcribes what he thinks beſt, perhaps ſome ſtrong Diuretical, or Cathartical Potion, whereby the Conception is deſtroyed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, There is a Neceſſity that Women ſhould be inſtructed in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Conception, that the Parent, as well as the Child, might be ſaved from Danger. I will therefore give you ſome Inſtructions by which every one may know whether ſhe be with Child or not. The ſigns of Conception ſhall be taken from the Woman, from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, from the Infant, and from Experiment.</p>
                  <p>Signs collected from the Woman are theſe; The firſt day after Conception, ſhe feels a light Quivering or Chilneſs running through the Whole Body; a tickling in the Womb, and a little Pain in the lower parts of the Belly.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153810:83"/>Ten or twelve Days after, the Head is affected with Giddineſs, the Eyes with a Dimneſ of Sight: Then follows Red Pimples in the Face, with a Blue Circle about the Eyes; the Breſts ſwell and grow hard with ſome pain and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them: The Belly ſuddenly ſinketh and riſeth again by Degrees, with a hardneſs about the Navel. The Nipples af the Breſt's wax Red; the Heart beats inordinately, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural appetite is Dejected, yet die hath a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſire after ſtrange Meats. The neck of the Womb is retraced, that it can hardly be felt with the Finger being put up; and this is an infallible Sign. She is ſuddenly Merry, and as ſoon Melancholly; her Monthly Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſtayed without any Evident Cauſe: The Excrements of the Guts are unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly retained by the VVomb preſſing the great Gut; and her Deſire to <hi>Venus</hi> is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>The ſureſt Sign is taken from the Infant, which begins to move in, the VVomb the third or fourth Month; and that not in the manner of a Mole, from one ſide to another, Ruſhing like a Stone; but mildly, as may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by applying the Hand hot on the Belly.</p>
                  <p>Signs taken from the Urine. The beſt Clerks do affirm that the Urine of a VVoman with Child is white, and hath little Motes, like thoſe in the Sun-beams, aſcending and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, and a Cloud ſwimming aloft of an Opal Colour; the Sediment being divided by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:153810:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhaking of the Urine, appears like carded VVool. In the middle of her time, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine turneth Yellow, next Red, and laſtly Black, with a Red Cloud. Signs taken from Experiment: At Night going to Bed, let her drink Water and Honey; afterward if ſhe feels a beating pain in her Belly, and about her Navel, ſhe hath Conceived. Or let her take the juice of <hi>Carduus,</hi> and if ſhe Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it up, it is a ſign of Conception? caſt a clean Needle into Womans Urine, put into a Baſon, let it ſtand all Night, and in the Morning if it be coloured with red Spots, ſhe hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but if it be blacker, or ruſty, ſhe hath not.</p>
                  <p>Signs taken from the Sex to ſhew whether it be Male or Female. Being with Child of a Male, the right Breaſt ſwells firſt; the right Eye is more lively than the left; her Face Well coloured; becauſe ſuch as the Blood is, ſuch is the Colour; and the Male is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of purer Blood, and of more perfect Seed than the Female. Red Motes in the Urine, ſettling down to the Sediment, foretells that a Male is conceived; but if they be white, a Female. Put the Womans Urine which is with Child, into a Glaſs Bottle, let it ſtand cloſe ſtopt three days; then ſtrain it through a fine Cloth, and you ſhall find littte living Creatures; if they be Red, it is a Male, if White a Female. To conclude the mod certain Sign to give Credit unto is the motion of the Infant: For the Male moves in the third Month, ad the Famale in the fourth,</p>

                  <p>WHen the Fruit of the Womb comes forth before the Seventh Month (that is before it comes to Maturity) it is ſaid to be Abortive: And in effect the Child proves A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive (I mean not to Live) if it be Born in the eighth Month. And why Children born in the ſeventh, and ninth Month, may Live, and not in the eighth Month, may ſeem ſtrange yet it is true: The cauſe hereof by ſome, is aſcribed unto the <hi>Planet,</hi> under which the Child is born; for every Month, from the Conception to the Birth, is Governed by his proper <hi>Planet:</hi> And in the Eighth Month <hi>Saturn</hi> doth Predominate, which is cold and dry, and coldneſſ being an Enemy unto Life deſtroys the Nature of the Child. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> gives a better Reaſon; The Infant being every way perfect, and compleat in the Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venth Month, deſires more Air and Nutriment than it had before, which becauſe he cannot obtain, he labours for a Paſſage to go out; and if his Spirits be weak and faint, and have not Strength ſufficient to break the Membranes and come forth, it is decreed by Nature that he ſhould continue in the Womb until the 9th Month, that, in that time his wearied Spirits might be again Strengthned and Refreſhed;

                     <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Untimely Birth may be cauſed by Cold; for as it maketh the Fruit of the Tree to wither and fall down before it be Ripe, ſo doth it Nip the Fruit of the Womb before it comes to full Perfection, and make it to be Abortive. Sometimes by Humidity, weakening the Faculty that the Fruit cannot be reſtrain'd until the due time; by Dryneſs or Emptineſs, defrauding the Child of his Nouriſhment; by one of the three Alvine Fluxes; by Phlebotomy and other Evacuations; by Inflammations of the Womb, and by other ſharp Diſeaſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is cauſed by Joy, Laughter, Anger, and eſpecially by Fear; for in all, but in that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the Heat forſakes the Womb, and runs to the Heart, to help there, and ſo the Cold ſtrikes into the <hi>Matrix,</hi> whereby the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Relaxt, and ſo Abortion follows. Wherefore <hi>Plato</hi> in his time, Commanded that the Women ſhould ſhun all Temptations of great Joy and Pleaſure, and likewiſe avoid all Occaſions of Fear and Grief. Abortion alſo may be cauſed by the Corruption of the Air; by filthy Odours, and eſpecially by the ſmell of the Snuff of a Candle; alſo by Falls, Blows, violent Exerciſe, Leaping, Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>THe prevention of Untimely Birth conſiſts in the taking away of the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cauſes, which muſt be effected both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Conception.</p>
                  <p>Before Conception, If the Body be over hot, Cold, Dry or Moiſt, correct it with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; if Cacochimical, Purge it; if Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, open the Liver Vein; if too Groſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate it; if too Lean, Corroborate and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it; all Diſeaſes of the Womb muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, as I have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>After Conception, let the Air be Temperate,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153810:87"/>Sleep not overmuch; avoid Watching, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Body, Paſſions of the Mind, loud Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and filthy Smells: Sweet Odours alſo are to be rejected of thoſe that are Hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Abſtain from all things which provoke either the Urine or Courſes, alſo from Salt, ſharp and windy Meats; a moderate Diet ſhall be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>If the Excrements of the Guts be retained, Lenifie the Belly with Clyſters made of the Decoction of Mallows, Violets, with Sugar, and common Oyl: Or make Broath with Borrage, Bugloſs, Beets, Mallows, taking in the ſame a little Manna. On the Contrary; if ſhe be troubled with Looſneſs of the Belly, let it not be frayed without the Judgment of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian: for all Uterine Fluxes have a malign Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them, which muſt be Evacuated before the Flux be ſtayed.</p>
                  <p>The Cough is another Accident which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth breeding Women, and puts them into great danger of Miſcarrying, ſo by continual Diſtillation falling from the Brain; to prevent which, ſhave away the Hair on the Coronal, and Sagittal Commiſſure, and apply thereon this Plaiſter: Take <hi>Reſinae,</hi> half an Ounce; <hi>Ladani</hi> one Dram; <hi>Citron-peels, Ligni A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes Olibani,</hi> of each one Scruple; <hi>Stirachis Liquidae, et Siccae,</hi> a ſufficient Quantity: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Gums in Vinegar, and make a Plaiſter. At night going to Bed, let her take the Fume of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trochisks caſt upon the Coals. Take
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153810:87"/>of <hi>Frankincenſe, Stirax,</hi> pouder of <hi>Red Roſes,</hi> of each one dram and a half, <hi>Sandarachae,</hi> 3 Drams; <hi>Maſtick, Benjamin, Amber,</hi> of each one Dram, with <hi>Turpentine</hi> make <hi>Trochisks.</hi> Apply a Cautery to the Nape of the Neck; and every Night let her take of theſe Pills following.

                  <p>In breeding Women there is a corrupted matter generated, which flowing to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle dejecteth the appetite and cauſeth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting: and the ſtomach being weak, not able to digeſt this matter, ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Take Ligni Aloes, Nutmeg, of each one dram, Mace, Cloves, Maſtick, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Take of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Borage, Bugloſs, Anthos, of each half an Ounce; Confect. de Hyacintho, Lemon Pills condited, Specierum Diamarg. Pulv. de
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153810:88"/>Gemmis, of each 2 drams; Nutmeg, Diam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae, of each 2 Scruples; Peony-Roots, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coralli, of each one dram; with Syrup of Roſes make an Electuary of which ſhe ſhall take twice a day, two hours before Meals. Another accident which perplexeth Women with Child, is ſwelling of the legs, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the firſt three Months, by ſuperfluous humours falling down from the ſtomach and liver; for the cure whereof, Take of Oyl of Roſes 2 drams, Salt, Vinegar of each a dram; ſhake them altogether until the ſalt be diſſolved, and anoint the legs hot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, chafing it in with the hand. But purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more proper, if it may be done without danger, as it may in the fourth, 5th and 6th Month of pregnation: for a Child in the Womb is compared to an Apple on the tree. The firſt three months it is weak and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſubject with the Apple to fall away: but afterwards the Membranes being ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the fruit remains firmly fattened in the Womb, not apt to miſchances; and ſo it continues, until the ſeventh month; then growing near the time of maturity, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments are again relaxt (like unto the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is almoſt ripe) and grow looſer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day until the time of delivery. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Body hath need of purging, ſhe way purge without danger in the 4th, 5th, or 6th month; but not before, nor after, unleſs in ſome ſharp diſeaſe, in which the Mother
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:153810:88"/>and Child both are like to periſh. Apply Plaiſters and Unguents to the reins, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the fruit of the Womb. Take of Gum Arabick, Galangale, Biſtort, Hypociſtid, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, of each one dram; Fine bole, Nutmeg, Maſtick, Belauſt, Sang, Draconis, Myrtle-berries one dram and half; Wax and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, a ſufficient quantity. Make a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: Apply it to the reins in the Winter time; and remove it every 14 days, leſt the reins be over hot therewith. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim anoint the privities and reins with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Comitiſſae.</hi> But if it be ſummer time, and the reins hot, this plaiſter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more proper. Take of red Roſes one pound, Maſtick, red Sanders, of each 2 drams, Bole-armeny, red Coral, Biſtort, of each one dram: Pomgranate Pills, prepared Coriander, of each 2 drams and half; Barberries two Scruples, Oyl of Maſtick and Quinces, of each one Ounce; juice of Plantain 2 drams: with Pitch make a Plaiſter, anoint the reins alſo with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Sandalinum.</hi> Once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very week waſh the reins with two parts of Roſe water and one part of White-wine, mingled together and warmed at the fire: this will aſſwage the heat of the reins, and diſperſe the Oyl of the Plaiſter out of the pores of the skin, and cauſe the Oyntment or Plaiſter, the ſooner to penetrate and, ſtrengthen the Womb. Some are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that as long as the Loadſtone is laid to

                  <p>The time of Birth drawing near, let the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſend for a skilful Midwife, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too ſoon than too late; againſt which time let her prepare a Pallet-Bed or Couch, and place it near the fire, that the Midwife and her Aſſiſtants may paſs round, and help on every ſide, as occaſion requires, having change of Linnen ready, and a ſmall Cricket or little Log to reſt her feet againſt, ſhe having more force when they are bowed, than when they are otherwiſe.</p>

Motion likewiſe will cauſe the Womb to open and dilate it ſelf, when lying long in Bed will be uneaſie; yet if ſhe be very weak, ſhe may take ſome gentle Cordial to refreſh her ſelf, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor muſt the woman her ſelf be faint-hearted, but of a good Courage, forcing her ſelf, by ſtraining and ſtopping her breath.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of Delivery, the Midwife muſt wait with Patience, till the Childs Head, or other Members, burſt the Membrane; for if through ignorance, or haſte to be gone to other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as ſome have done, the Midwife tear the Membrane with her Nails, ſhe endangers both the Woman and the Child; for it lying dry, and wanting that ſlipperineſs that ſhould make it eaſie, it comes forth with greater pain.</p>
                  <p>When the Head appears, the Midwife muſt gently hold it between her two hands, and draw the Child at ſuch times as the Womans pangs are upon her, and at no other, ſlipping by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees her four fingers under its Arm-pits, not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:153810:90"/>uſing a rough hand in drawing it forth, leſt by that means the tender Infant receive any Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Body.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Child is taken forth, which is for the moſt part with its Face downwards, let it be laid upon its back, that it may more freely receive external Reſpiration; then cut the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring about three Inches from the body, tying that end which adheres to the belly, with a ſilken ſtring, as near as you can, then cover the Head and Stomach of the Child well, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering nothing to come upon the Face.</p>
                  <p>The Child being thus drawn forth, and in health, lay it aſide, and let the Midwife regard the Patient, in drawing forth the Secundine: And this ſhe may do by wagging and ſtirring them up and down, and afterwards with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hand drawing them forth; and if the work be difficult let the Woman hold Salt in her hands, ſhut them cloſe, and breathe hard into them, and thereby ſhe ſhall know whether the Membranes be broken or not: It may be alſo known by cauſing her to ſtrain or vomit, by putting one Finger down her Throat, or by ſtraining or moving her lower parts, but let all be done out of hand. If this fail, let her take a draught of raw Elder-water, or the Yolk of a new-laid Egg, or ſmell to a piece of Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetida, eſpecially if ſhe be troubled with the Wind-Cholick. If ſhe happen to take cold, it is a great Obſtruction to the coming down of ſhe Secundines, and in ſuch caſes the Midwife
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153810:91"/>ought to chafe the womans belly gently, which breaks not only the Wind, but obliges the Secundines to come down,; but theſe proving ineffectual, the Midwife muſt dilate with her Hand the exterior Orifice of the Womb, and gently draw it forth.</p>
                  <p>Having now diſcourſed of common Births, or ſuch as for the moſt part are eaſie, I ſhall now give Directions in caſe of Extremity.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:153810:94"/>muſt be well waſhed and anointed, and the Woman laid in her Bed, and comforted with Spices, and Cordials: This courſe muſt be taken in the delivery of all dead Children, likewiſe with Moles, Secundines, and falſe Births, that will not of themſelves come forth in due ſeaſon; or if the inſtruments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, will not ſufficiently widen the Womb, then other inſtruments, as the Drakes Bill, and long Pincers, ought to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>If it ſo happen that any Inflammation, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or congealed Blood, be contracted in the <hi>Matrix,</hi> under the Film of thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, either before or after the Birth, where the matter appears thinner, then let the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife with a Penknife or inciſion inſtrument, Launch it; and preſs out the corruption, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a Peſſary dipped in Oyl of Red Roſes.</p>
                  <p>If at any time through cold or ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, the Child happen to be ſwelled in any part, or have contracted a watery Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, if it remain alive, ſuch means muſt be uſed as are leaſt injurious to the Child or <hi>Mother;</hi> but if it be dead, that Tumour muſt be let out by inciſion to facilitate the Birth.</p>
                  <p>If (as it often happens) that the Child comes with its Feet foremoſt, and the Hands, dilating themſelves from the Hips, in ſuch caſe the Midwife muſt be provided of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Oyntments to ſtroke and anoint the Infant with, to help its coming forth, leſt it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153810:94"/>return again into the Womb, holding at the ſame time, both the Arms of the Infant, cloſe to the Hips, that ſo it may iſſue forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its manner, but if it prove too big, the Womb muſt be well anointed. The Woman may alſo take ſneezing Pouder, to make her ſtrain; thoſe that attend, may gently ſtroke down her Belly, to make the Birth deſcend, and keep the Child from retiring back.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it falls out that the Child com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with its Feet foremoſt, has its Arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended above its Head, but the Midwife muſt not receive it ſo, but put it back into the Womb, unleſs the Paſſage be extraordinary wide, and then ſhe muſt anoint both the Child and the Womb; nor is it ſafe to draw it forth before it is put into due form, which muſt be done after this manner: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be laid upon her Back, with her Head depreſſed, and her Buttocks raiſed, and then the Midwife with a ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If a Child happen to come forth with one Foot, the Arm being extended along the ſide, and the other Foot turned backward, then muſt the Woman be inſtantly brought to her Bed, and laid in the poſture above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153810:95"/>at what time the Midwife muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſully put back the Foot ſo appearing, and the Woman rocking her ſelf from one ſide to the other, till ſhe find the Child is turned; but ſhe muſt not alter her poſture, nor turn upon her Face, after which ſhe may expect her pains, and muſt have great aſſiſtance, and Cordials, to revive and ſupport her Spirits.</p>
                  <p>At other times it happens that the Child <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>les croſs in the Womb, and falls upon its ſide; in this caſe, the Woman muſt not be urged in her Labour, neither can any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Birth in that manner: Therefore the Midwife, when ſhe finds it ſo, ſhe muſt uſe great diligence to reduce it to its right form, or at leaſt to ſuch a form in the Womb, as may make the delivery poſſible, and moſt Eaſie, by moving the Buttocks, and guiding the Head to the Paſſage, and if ſhe be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful herein, let her again try by rocking her ſelf to and fro, and wait with patience till it change its manner of lying.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Child haſtens the Birth, with its Legs and Arms expanded, in which, as in the former, the Woman muſt rock her ſelf, but not with violence, till ſhe find thoſe parts fall to their proper ſtations, or it may be done by a gentle compreſſion of the Womb: but if neither of them prevail, the Midwife with her Hand muſt cloſe the Legs of the Infant, and if ſhe can come at them, do the like to the Arms, and ſo draw it forth; but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153810:95"/>if it can be reduced of it ſelf to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of a natural Birth, it is better.</p>
                  <p>If the Infant come forward with both Knees foremoſt, and the Hands hanging down upon the Thighs, then muſt the Midwife put both Knees upward, till the Feet appear, taking hold of which with her Left Hand, let her keep her Right Hand on the ſide of the Child, and in that poſture endeavour to bring it forth; but if ſhe cannot, then muſt the Woman rock her ſelf till the Child is in a more convenient poſture for Delivery.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it happens that the Child preſſes forward with one arm ſtretch'd upon its thighs, and the other raiſed over its head, and the feet likewiſe ſtretch'd out at length in the Womb; in ſuch a caſe the Midwife muſt not attempt to receive the Child in that poſture, but muſt lay the Woman upon the Bed in the manner before recited, making a ſoft and gentle Compreſſion upon her belly, to oblige the Infant to retire; which if it do not, then muſt the Midwiſe thruſt it back by the ſhoulders, and bring the arm that was ſtretched above the head to its right place, for certain it is, there is moſt danger in theſe Extremities; and therefore the Midwife muſt obſerve to anoint her hands firſt, and the womb of the woman, with ſweet Butter, or ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <hi>Pomatum,</hi> thruſting up her hand as near as ſhe can to the arm of the Infant, and reduce it to the ſide; but if that cannot ſo be done, let the woman be laid on her Bed, there to reſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:153810:96"/>for a while, in which time perhaps the Child may be reduced to a better poſture, which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If an Infant come with its Buttocks foremoſt, and almoſt double, then the Midwife anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand, muſt thruſt it up, and gently heaving up the buttocks and the back, ſtrive to turn the head to the paſſage, but not too haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt the Infant retiring ſhould ſhape it worſe; and therefore if it cannot be turned with the hand, the woman muſt rock her ſelf upon her Bed, taking ſuch comfortable things as may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her Spirits till ſhe perceive the Child to turn.</p>
                  <p>If a Childs neck be bowed, and it comes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with its ſhoulders, as it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and with its hands and feet ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Then the Midwife muſt gently move the ſhoulders, that ſhe may direct the head to the paſſage; and the better to effect it, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt rock her ſelf, as afore directed. Theſe and other the like methods are to be obſerved in all ſingle Births: And the ſame may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in caſe a woman have Twins, or three Children at a birth, as ſometimes happens: For as the ſingle Birth has but one Natural way, and many Unnatural Forms, even ſo it may be in double or treble births: Wherefore in ſuch caſes the Midwife muſt take care to receive that firſt, which is neareſt the paſſage, but not letting the other go, leſt by retiring it ſhould
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153810:96"/>change the Form; and when one is born, ſhe muſt be ſpeedy in bringing forth the other; and this Birth, if it be in the natural way, is more eaſie; becauſe the Children are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs than thoſe of a ſingle birth, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a leſſer paſſage; but if this birth comes unnaturally, it is more dangerous than the other.</p>
                  <p>In the birth of Twins, let the Midwife be very careful that the Secundines be naturally brought forth, leſt the Womb being delivered of its burthen, fall; and ſo the Secundine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues there longer than is conſiſtent with the womans ſafety.</p>
                  <p>But if one of the Twins happen to come with the head, the other with the feet foremoſt, then let the Midwife deliver the natural birth firſt, and then if ſhe cannot turn the other, draw it out in the poſture it preſſes forward; but if that with its feet downward be before the other, ſhe may deliver that firſt, turning the other aſide.</p>
                  <p>But in this caſe the Midwife muſt carfully ſee that it be not a Monſtrous Birth inſtead of Twins; as a body with two heads, or two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies joyned together, which ſhe may ſoon know, if both the heads come foremoſt, by putting up her hand between them, as high as ſhe can; and then if ſhe find they are Twins, ſhe muſt gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>y put one of them aſide, to make, way for the other; taking that firſt which is moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, having regard to the other, that ſhe do not change its ſituation.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſafety of the firſt Child, as ſoon
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:153810:97"/>as it comes forth out of the Womb, the Mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wife muſt tye the Navel-Sring, as has been be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore directed; and alſo bind with a large and long Fillet that part of the Navel that is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to the Secundines, the more readily to find them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Infant being born, let the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife carefully examine whether there be not two Secundines, for it ſometimes falls out that by the ſhortneſs of the Ligament it retires back, to the prejudice of the woman: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left the Womb ſhould cloſe, it is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to haſten them forth with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>If two Infants are joyned together by the Body, as ſometimes Monſtrouſly falls out, then although the Heads ſhould come foremoſt, yet it is convenient, if poſſible, to turn them, and draw them forth by the Feet, obſerving when they come to the Hips, to draw them forth as ſoon as may be: And here great Care ought to be uſed in anointing and widening the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.

                  <p>IF a VVoman has had very hard Labour, then after Delivery it is convenient to wrap her in the Skin of a Sheep taken off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is cold, putting the fleſhy ſide to her Reins and Belly, or for want of this, the Skin of a <hi>Hare</hi> or <hi>Coney,</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>layed off as ſoon as killed, may be applied to the ſame Parts; and in ſo doing the Dilation made in the Birth will be cloſed up, and the Melancholly Blood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from thoſe parts: And theſe may be continued the ſpace of an hour or two; after which let the VVoman be ſwathed with a fine Linnen Cloth, about a quarter of a Yard in length, chaſing her belly before it be Swathed, with Oyl of St. <hi>Johnſwort,</hi> after that raiſe up the Matrix with a linnen Cloth many times folded, then with a little Pillow or Quilt cover her Flanks, then place the Swathe ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Hanches, winding it pretty ſtiff, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying at the ſame time a warm Cloth to her Nipples, and not preſently applying Remedies, to keep back the Milk, by reaſon the body at ſuch a time is out of Frame, for there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vein nor Artery which does not ſtrongly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:153810:98"/>beat, and Remedies to drive back the Milk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a diſſolving Nature, it is improper to apply them to the Breſt during ſuch Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leſt by ſo doing, evil humours be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the Breſt, wherefore twelve hours ought to be at the leaſt allowed for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and ſettlement of the <hi>Blood,</hi> and what was caſt upon the Lungs by the vehement Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation during the Labour, to retire to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Receptacles.</p>
                  <p>A while after Delivery you may make a reſtrictive of the Yolk of two Eggs and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pint of <hi>White-wine,</hi> Oyl of S. <hi>John's Wort,</hi> Oyl of <hi>Roſes,</hi> Plantain and <hi>Roſe-water,</hi> of each one Ounce; mix them together, fold a Linnen Cloth, and dip therein, warm it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a gentle Fire, and apply it to the Breſt, and the Pains of thoſe parts will be greatly eaſed.</p>
                  <p>She muſt by no means Sleep preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Delivery; but about four hours aften ſhe may take <hi>Broath, Caudle,</hi> or what other liquid matter is nouriſhing, and then if ſhe be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Sleep, it may be ſafely permitted. And this is as much, in caſe of a Natural <hi>Birth,</hi> as ought immediately to be done.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe of Extremity, or an Unnatural Birth, theſe Rules ought to be obſerved. In the firſt place, let the VVoman keep a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Diet, by no means over-charging her ſelf after ſuch an exceſſive Evacuation; not being ruled or giving Credit to unskilful Nurſes, who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:153810:98"/>admoniſh them to feed heartily, the better to repair the loſs of Blood; for that Blood is not for the moſt part, pure, but ſuch as has been detained in the Veſſels or Membranes, better avoided for the health of the VVoman than kept, unleſs there happens an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Flux of Blood: for if her Nouriſhment be too much, it may make her liable to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and increaſe the Milk to ſuperfluity, which Curdling, often turns to Apoſthumes.</p>
